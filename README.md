# AI Learning Journey
## Day 1: PyCharm Setup
After experiencing unresolvable issues with VS Code, I switched to PyCharm for Python/Ollama.
-Tokenized Performance Management text from IRM 6.430.1 to CSV.
-Ran local LLM (Llama 3.2) for an explanation of the Four Step Model.
Next: RAG with IRS documents.

## Day 2: RAG Setup
Oh man, talk about nightmares. Lots of errors, but with Grok's help, and a bit of outside-the-box thinking, I was able to 
resolve them all.
-Processed IRM 6.430.1 with NLTK/Pandas (tokenized, saved key terms).
-Built basic RAG with LlamaIndex, queried IRM for Introduction to Performance Management.
Next: Expand RAG with more documents, improve prompt engineering.
