1.5.1.1 (06-30-2023)
Program Scope and Objectives
Purpose:
To provide an overview of the IRS Balanced Performance Measurement System."
To outline how the IRS uses the IRS Balanced Performance Measurement System to measure organizational performance.
"To provide general guidance and direction for IRS business units on the appropriate use and application of balanced measures, since it is not possible to prescribe acceptable actions for every situation."
"Audience: IRS executives, managers and IRS performance measures staff
Policy owner: Associate CFO for Corporate Budget
Program owner: Associate CFO for Corporate Budget
Primary stakeholders: CFO and IRS performance measures staff
Program goals: To create and maintain Servicewide performance measures that comply with the authorities listed below and that reflect the IRS mission and priorities."
"1.5.1.1.1 (06-30-2023)
Background
The IRS developed the Balanced Performance Measurement System to reflect its priorities consistent with its mission and strategic goals."
"To help ensure balance, the IRS considers each of the three components of balanced measures - customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and business results - when setting organizational objectives, establishing targets, assessing progress and results and evaluating organizational performance."
Each component is given equal importance.
The IRS uses balanced measures at both the strategic and operational levels to measure organizational performance.
Business units support Servicewide strategic goals.
"Business units do not establish additional Servicewide strategic goals, but develop internal plans that align with the Servicewide goals."
"See IRM 6.430, Performance Management, for evaluating individual performance."
"1.5.1.1.2 (01-16-2025)
Authorities
The following laws and regulations establish and support the Balanced Performance Measurement System in addition to this IRM:
The IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (RRA '98), which requires the IRS to change its measures to balance customer service with its overall tax administration responsibilities."
"26 CFR Part 801, Balanced System for Measuring Organizational and Employee Performance, implements the IRS Balanced Performance Measurement System."
"Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) and the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) require agencies to prepare annual performance plans for their programs that show quantifiable, measurable performance goals, indicators and comparisons to actual results."
The Taxpayer First Act requires the IRS to identify metrics and benchmarks for quantitatively measuring the progress of the IRS in implementing a comprehensive customer service strategy.
"IRM 1.2.2.2.10 Delegation Order 1-11, Signing Reports on Budget Status Required by Office of Management and Budget Circular A-11."
"1.5.1.1.3 (06-30-2023)
Responsibilities
To integrate and use the Balanced Performance Measurement System Servicewide, each organization is responsible for establishing a:
Comprehensive approach for measuring and using customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and business results (quantity and quality) data;
Clear strategy for using all elements of balanced measures in strategic, operational and business planning; and
Commitment to ensuring, explaining and demonstrating how it uses and addresses customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and business results in its business decisions."
"The role of the Associate CFO for Corporate Budget, the IRS’s Performance Improvement Officer, and the Deputy Performance Improvement Officer, is to collect data from the business units and report them out to the IRS’ internal and external stakeholders."
"The Associate CFO for Corporate Budget does not own any IRS performance measures, but serves as a custodian of the highest-level measures reported across the enterprise."
The Associate CFO for Corporate Budget acts as a second level reviewer for data and measures.
"Occasionally, the Associate CFO for Corporate Budget supports business units with measure development and approval."
The role of individual business units is to own the various performance measures that are subsequently reported out by the IRS’s Performance Improvement Officer and the deputy.
"As the owner of a performance measure, a business unit is responsible for:
Maintaining the accuracy of the measure reported;
Gathering all component data used to calculate the measure in the current period and set targets for current and future periods;
Implementing controls to ensure the accuracy of any component data;
Setting targets for established measures for current and future periods;
Maintaining and providing annual updates to the data dictionary entry for the measure;
Gathering forecast data from the various components of a measure to generate targets;
Providing detailed information explaining any factors that impact performance, any reasoning for target shortfalls, and future plans statements upon request; and
Establishing targets for indicators upon request by the IRS Performance Improvement Officer by the start of the next budget cycle or providing a business case for why targets should not be set, as noted in IRM 1.5.1.2(1)(c) Performance Measures Quick Reference."
"1.5.1.1.4 (06-30-2023)
Program Management and Review
Program Reports: Before proposing a new measure for inclusion in the IRS budget or Strategic Plan, an organization must complete the Detailed Measures Template included in Exhibit 1.5.1–5, Detailed Measures Template."
"The organization should use the template to facilitate a common understanding across a measure’s definition, formula, data reliability, reporting frequency, purpose, limitations and controls."
This is essential to meeting various oversight requirements.
"Program Effectiveness: Each organization is responsible for periodically updating its performance measures according to IRM 1.5.1.9, Proposing, Reviewing and Updating Performance Budget Measures, and Exhibits 1.5.1-1 through 1.5.1-5 to ensure measure effectiveness."
Each organization will provide periodic feedback to the Associate CFO for Corporate Budget on the effectiveness of measures from their perspective.
The Associate CFO for Corporate Budget also will provide periodic feedback to each organization on outside perspectives of measure effectiveness.
"1.5.1.1.5 (06-30-2023)
Program Controls
Each organization is responsible for creating and maintaining a Data Dictionary and submitting a copy to the Associate CFO for Corporate Budget for each measure that is included in the IRS budget, the IRS Strategic Plan and any other requested measures."
"This document follows the program reports guidance in IRM 1.5.1.1.4, Program Management and Review, and ensures program controls for each measure by documenting the procedure used and facilitating a common understanding across a measure’s definition, formula, data reliability, reporting frequency, purpose, limitations and controls."
Each organization is responsible for creating and maintaining program controls for its internal performance data.
The CFO provides guidance but does not assess business units’ internal performance measures.
"It is the responsibility of each business unit to ensure their procedures are followed, including any remediation identified or if targets are not met."
"1.5.1.1.6 (08-25-2025)
Terms/Definitions
The following terms and definitions apply to this program:

1.5.1.2 (06-30-2023)
Performance Measures Quick Reference
The following is a quick reference for the IRS balanced performance measurement system."
"The IRS must carefully consider each of the three components of balanced measures - customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and business results - when setting organizational objectives, establishing goals, assessing progress and results, and evaluating individual performance."
"Under the IRS Balanced Performance Measurement System, the approved set of balanced measures is the primary means for assessing organizational performance."
The IRS can use other information and data for purposes such as workload planning and analysis.
"Each measure should have targets based on the previous year's results, historical patterns, and the anticipated mix of resources available."
"Additional considerations include the linkage to organizational priorities and initiatives, planned process improvements or system enhancements, an assessment of existing and emerging trends, and internal and external issues."
"Measures may be categorized as indicators for a short time when initially created, in the absence of historical data, and when there’s a lessened degree of control over the measurable value."
Targets are not required for indicators.
"Targets set for quantity business results must always consider the effects on customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and quality."
"The IRS may use quantity measures to evaluate and/or set or suggest goals for organizational units at levels that do not measure customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction or quality, if such measures exist at a higher level in the organization."
"The IRS should not use the performance of any one unit as a standard by which the performance of other units are evaluated because of differences in the types of taxpayers served, specific tax issues addressed and other factors."
"However, some measures at the Servicewide level may combine aspects of multiple business units into one measure."
"In these cases, individual business units should track their own performance separately from the combined measure."
The primary focus of organizational reviews should be on the effectiveness of actions taken and accomplishments.
The numeric results achieved for any measure will never directly equate to the evaluation of an individual.
"Because measures reported by the IRS externally are subject to extensive evaluation and review, measure evaluation should meet an especially rigorous set of standards."
"In determining the appropriateness of a specific course of action, managers and employees should exercise sound judgment consistent with 26 CFR Part 801, Balanced System for Measuring Organizational and Employee Performance within the Internal Revenue Service."
"1.5.1.3 (11-01-2011)
The IRS Balanced Performance Measurement System
The IRS Balanced Performance Measurement System provides a means to:
Establish priorities."
Guide and motivate performance and establish a link between performance targets and organizational goals and objectives.
Obtain feedback to identify how well the IRS meets customer and stakeholder expectations and to identify areas for improvement.
Assess overall program effectiveness and communicate results.
"1.5.1.3.1 (05-20-2019)
Components of the Balanced Performance Measurement System
The components of the balanced performance measurement system are
Customer satisfaction
Employee satisfaction
Business results (comprising quantity and quality measures)
Each component represents an important aspect of the organization's goals, and each should be given equal importance in carrying out the objectives of IRS programs."
"Some of the components do not change as rapidly as others or require more time for data collection; therefore, the frequency of data availability across the three components may vary."
"However, differences in the frequency of data availability do not reflect differences in priority."
"1.5.1.3.2 (05-20-2019)
The Goals of Customer Satisfaction, Employee Satisfaction and Business Results
The IRS’s overall objective is to attain:
A high level of customer satisfaction by providing professional services to both internal and external customers courteously and timely;
A high level of employee satisfaction by achieving a productive and enabling work environment with quality leadership, adequate training and effective support services; and
An adequate level of quality business results, coupled with meaningful outreach to customers."
"1.5.1.3.3 (08-25-2025)
Measuring Customer Satisfaction
The IRS gathers information to measure customer satisfaction from a statistically valid sample of the taxpayers served by a particular organizational unit or who have recently interacted with a particular IRS program."
"The IRS accomplishes this by using surveys for the organizational unit overall and transactional surveys for its major programs that:
Affect a significant proportion of the customers served by the organizational unit and/or
Use a significant proportion of the total resources (full-time equivalents and dollars) of the organizational unit."
"While the IRS should obtain customer feedback for all programs, a survey instrument or satisfaction score may not be possible or meaningful for every program."
"The intent of the customer satisfaction component of the balanced performance measurement system is to ensure the IRS considers and addresses customer satisfaction issues and needs in organizational planning, budgeting and review activities."
"Example: When developing strategies to improve business results, the IRS should consider the effect on customer satisfaction outcomes."
Organizations should review survey results on a regular basis and develop plans that include specific strategies aimed at improving customer satisfaction.
"Note: The IRS guarantees customer anonymity consistent with 26 CFR 801.4, Customer Satisfaction Measures."
"Customer satisfaction also includes measuring customer experience or taxpayer experience as per OMB Circular A-11, Section 280."
"1.5.1.3.4 (05-14-2021)
Measuring Employee Satisfaction
The IRS measures employee satisfaction for organizational business units, functional business units and work groups."
"With some exceptions, it is typically not measurable for programs because the IRS allocates employee time to more than one program and spreads many programs across organizational units."
"The intent of the employee satisfaction component of a balanced performance measurement system is to ensure the IRS considers and addresses employee satisfaction issues and needs in organizational planning, budgeting and review activities."
"Example: Strategies to improve business results must consider and address the effect on employees, when applicable."
"Organizations should review annual employee survey results, such as the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS), and develop plans that contain specific strategies aimed at improving employee satisfaction, if applicable."
"1.5.1.3.5 (05-20-2019)
Measuring Business Results
The IRS assesses operational level business results through output or quantity measures and quality measures."
"Output or quantity measures consist of outcome-neutral production and resource data like the number of cases closed, work items completed, and hours expended."
"Quality measures consist of data such as case/call review data, accuracy and timeliness."
They can also include efficiency measures.
The intent of measuring both quantity and quality is to ensure the IRS generates a productive quantity of work in a quality manner.
"1.5.1.3.6 (06-30-2023)
Performance Measures Objectives
The IRS can establish performance measures to assess progress at three levels:
Budget level measures to support IRS budget requests."
Strategic level measures to assess Servicewide progress towards accomplishing the mission and goals established by the strategic plan.
"Since each IRS business unit supports the IRS strategic goals, they do not establish additional Servicewide strategic goals."
Operational level measures to assess the effectiveness of specific programs.
"Example: Submission Processing, Filing and Accounts Management, Field Collection and Field Exam."
"The IRS has three types of performance measures:
Outcome measures describe the intended result of carrying out a program or activity."
Output or quantity measures describe the level of activity that will be provided over a period of time.
"Efficiency or quality measures capture skillfulness in executing programs, implementing activities and achieving results while avoiding wasted resources, effort, time and/or money."
Note: The IRS establishes a baseline for first-year measures or indicators and future targets are based on prior year performance and current budgetary considerations.
"1.5.1.4 (05-14-2021)
Using Performance Information
The IRS collects information about programs and services and uses some of it to establish performance measures."
The IRS uses other information and data for workload planning and analysis.
"The Balanced Performance Measurement System enables the IRS to use performance results to:
Measure how an organizational unit performs relative to its past performance."
"Identify areas for improvement by considering results from measures of customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and business results."
Align and support various review processes.
Identify the factors that influence performance.
"Provide input to a manager’s performance appraisals, but not serve as a direct evaluative tool."
Report to Treasury as required by GPRAMA.
"1.5.1.5 (06-21-2021)
Using Workload Indicators and Diagnostic Tools for Planning and Analysis
The IRS uses workload indicators for resource planning during the development of program plans and budgets."
"Workload indicators project expected levels of activity for an organization or program, identify resource needs and justify the IRS budget requests to the Department of the Treasury, OMB and Congress."
"Example: Refunds issued, number of walk-in customers and number of returns filed."
Organizational performance assessments include workload indicators to compare actual workload to planned workload for making future projections and estimating resource requirements.
Diagnostic tools are any data used to understand what influences and affects performance.
"In some cases, organizations may share data used as a diagnostic tool for their organization (such as cycle time) so that other organizations may use it as a budget level measure."
This is permissible if the measure conforms to the guidelines and restrictions set forth in this IRM.
"Using diagnostic tools and workload indicators provides a mechanism to study the factors that influence performance and identify opportunities that managers can take to improve customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and business results."
The business units may establish improvement targets for diagnostic tools and workload indicators but only in direct support of overlying budget or operational level measures.
"Using results from diagnostic tools or workload indicators to compare one unit to other units may be appropriate for conducting analysis, exploring best practices or seeking process enhancements to improve the overarching balanced measure(s)."
The IRS uses diagnostic tools and/or workload indicators to identify and understand the underlying factors that cause changes in the balanced measures.
"Examples of diagnostic tools and workload indicators:
Customer satisfaction/experience survey results (for example: particular survey questions, identified improvement priorities, narrative comments)
Employee survey results
Cycle time
Employee experience/training/skill levels (for example: hours of training per employee, work force mix, average education level of newly-hired employees)
External factors (for example, tax law macroeconomic cycles)
Employee absenteeism and/or turnover rates
Return closures per unit of effort
Inventory level
Individual Master File (IMF)/Business Master File (BMF) workload mix
Staffing resources (for example, full-time equivalent (FTE) appropriated, FTE realized and resource utilization)
Results for individual quality standards/elements
Wait time/transaction time
Cost information
Number of returns filed
Records of Tax Enforcement Results (ROTERs) (More information on ROTERs can be found in IRM 1.5.2, Uses of Section 1204 Statistics.)"
Note: Organizations will set no targets and make no comparisons between units for ROTERs.
"1.5.1.6 (06-30-2023)
Setting Targets or Performance Goals
There are two types of targets an organization can use to communicate priorities and guide performance - qualitative and quantitative:
Qualitative targets are general in nature and suggest a desired direction."
"Example: ""Improve Customer Satisfaction""
Quantitative or numeric targets are specific."
"Example: ""Improve Customer Satisfaction from 70% to 80%""
The IRS will use actual results against qualitative and numeric targets to report on agency progress in delivering its tax administration responsibilities."
All levels of the organization can establish qualitative targets to support organizational strategies and plans.
"Organizations should base numeric targets for any measure on a review of prior year results, historical patterns, the anticipated mix of resources available, the link to organizational priorities and initiatives and an assessment of existing and emerging trends, internal and external issues and problems."
Note: Organizations should establish a baseline for first-year measures or indicators and base future targets on first-year actuals.
"1.5.1.6.1 (05-20-2019)
Communicating Targets
The IRS must exercise caution in how numeric targets are shared within the organization to avoid numbers-focused pressures."
"Servicewide and organizational unit numeric targets will be included in documents that are distributed broadly both within and outside the organization, including performance budget submissions, Business Performance Review (BPR) documents and internal program plans."
These documents and the numeric targets included therein can be shared and discussed with both managerial and non-managerial employees at the discretion of management.
"The following questions may help guide the decision to provide numerical targets:
What is the business reason for communicating the numeric target?"
What is the business risk of not providing the numeric target?
What is the potential undesirable outcome that could come from the misuse of the numeric target and how can that outcome be minimized?
"Regarding (3) above, consider:
The degree of organizational knowledge and understanding of the intended recipients."
The organizational climate at the time and place of the communication.
The context in which the communication will to be made.
Any guidance on how the numeric target can or cannot be used.
How the communication is delivered.
The expectation of follow-up with respect to the numeric target and the nature of the expected follow-up.
The probable perception of the communication of the numeric target internally and externally.
"1.5.1.7 (05-20-2019)
Evaluating the Performance of an Organizational Unit
In conducting a formal review of an organization's performance, the IRS will use the balanced performance measures as the indicators used to determine achievement of the targets outlined in the annual program plan."
"The primary focus of organizational reviews should be on the actions taken and related accomplishments, not numeric results."
"Reviews also should be forward-looking, using the information and results obtained to identify plan revisions and improvement opportunities."
"During an organizational review, units can communicate the numeric results achieved for any of the balanced performance measures to provide a point of reference for a more detailed discussion of the actions taken to help achieve the IRS mission and strategic goals."
Organizational units may use workload indicators and diagnostic tools to help explain factors that may affect the balanced performance measures results.
"1.5.1.8 (05-20-2019)
Evaluating Performance of an Individual
For detailed information on evaluating individual performance see IRM 6.430.3, Performance Management Program for Evaluating Managers, Management Officials and Confidential Management/Program Analysts."
"The IRS will base non-supervisory employee evaluations on critical elements or performance standards, as appropriate, and the review of work performed."
The IRS will not directly tie individual evaluations to achievement of numeric goals.
The IRS will base supervisory evaluations on the actions taken in accordance with an agreed upon plan and performance standards.
Evaluations may mention the achievement of numeric goals in the narrative section in manager evaluations as analytical input to determine whether the actions taken achieved the desired performance result.
Direct measures of performance may not use numeric measures.
"Using the above guidance, when focusing on actions taken to achieve desired performance results, a supervisor's written evaluations or performance discussions may cite the specific goal or result to demonstrate the effect of the supervisor's actions."
"Example: ""John Smith met the performance goals established in his performance plan."
"As a direct result of John implementing (cite specific actions taken), his office closed 500 more cases than the goal."""
"1.5.1.9 (01-16-2025)
Proposing, Reviewing and Updating Performance Budget Measures
A performance budget is a presentation that clearly explains the relationship between performance goals and the costs for achieving targeted performance levels."
The IRS uses performance measures in its budget to illustrate this relationship.
"In general, a performance budget links strategic goals with related outcome-oriented, long-term and annual performance goals and the costs of specific activities that contribute to achieving those goals."
"While management will need to collect enough measures to capture all aspects of performance, external policymakers will primarily be interested in the success of the program."
Performance budget measures focus on results and the desired achievement of a program or service.
Division commissioners and heads of office are accountable for performance results.
Organizational units are responsible for providing the Associate CFO for Corporate Budget with accurate and timely progress reports for their organization’s performance budget measures to ensure that the IRS meets internal and external reporting deadlines.
"Establishing Performance Targets for Budget Submissions
Organizations should base their performance targets for the annual budget requests to Treasury, OMB and Congress on current year actual performance and a set of assumptions, which include, but are not limited to, budget assumptions provided by the Associate CFO for Corporate Budget."
"They should provide to the Associate CFO for Corporate Budget each performance target and explain the basis on which the IRS established the target and known factors that contribute to increases or decreases in performance, such as inflation or new workload."
"Assumptions must be included for all:

Output/outcome measures (that is, unit count measures)."
"Efficiency measures (that is, the assumed number of FTEs or staff years (SYs) and their productivity)."
Fully loaded FTEs or SYs should be used for this purpose unless there are sound business reasons for an exception.
Organizational units should note and fully document such exceptions.
Accuracy or quality measures assumptions must lay out the contributing factors and their relative weight to the overall score.
"Example: A quality measure might include weights of one-third each on following the correct process, accuracy and speed of response."
"Corporate Budget will submit the list of budget level measures, proposed targets and explanations of known factors influencing planned increases or decreases in performance to IRS leadership."
IRS leadership will approve or disapprove the proposed targets before they are included in the IRS budget submission.
"See applicable Delegation Order in IRM 1.2.2.2.10, Signing Reports on Budget Status Reports Required by Office of Management and Budget Circular A-11."
Business units are responsible for reviewing performance data as this data is regularly reported externally.
Each operating division conducts the BPR process.
"During these reviews, division commissioners and heads of office discuss their progress on meeting their performance targets or goals and new or emerging issues that may affect major programs and/or performance."
The Department of Treasury requires the IRS to report progress on its suite of performance budget measures quarterly in the Performance Measures Manager (PMM) system.
The IRS reports its performance on the budget level measures in the annual Management’s Discussion and Analysis Report (MD&A) and the annual Congressional Budget Justification and Annual Performance Plan (CJ).
"The MD&A is part of GAO’s annual audit of the IRS’s financial statements, available at GAO.gov."
Treasury publishes all budget and performance documents on Treasury.gov.
The IRS publishes relevant budget and performance measures information on IRS.gov.
The IRS shall take into consideration the results of external audits when updating performance measures as appropriate.
"In general, it is best to ensure the accuracy of all measures; however, performance budget measures data must be accurate and reliable so decision-makers can base their decisions on valid information."
"Since balanced performance measures reported by the IRS externally are subject to extensive evaluation and review, this set of measures should meet an especially rigorous set of standards."
Meaningful - The measure should be significant and directly related to the mission and goal.
"Example: If the goal of a program is to provide service to taxpayers, the measures that tell how well the IRS served those taxpayers are most meaningful."
Valid - The measure should accurately represent the desired output.
Example: A measure of customer satisfaction based only on internal data does not fully reflect the purpose of the measure.
Customer focused - The measure should reflect the customers’ and stakeholders’ points of view.
Example: Organizational units should measure the quality of their work products or services in part on the customers’ definition of quality.
Credible - The measure must be based on accurate and reliable data.
Example: Organizational units should choose cases selected for a quality measure at random to ensure the resulting score accurately reflects the work performed.
Cost effective - The measure should be based upon acceptable data collection and processing costs.
"Example: If the costs of collecting statistically valid data at all levels of the organization outweigh the expected benefits of the information obtained, the organization may choose to limit the measure to higher levels or require a lower level of precision."
"Understandable - The measure should be easy to calculate, interpret and understand."
Example: Whenever possible measures should be understandable to interested outside parties with limited IRS experience and should be free from IRS jargon.
Comparable - The measure is useful for making comparisons with other data over time.
Example: An organization may consider basing an internal quality score on the same sample of cases/calls used to measure customer satisfaction to compare internal results to external perceptions over time.
Periodically performance measures may need to be updated.
"As priorities change and new program requirements evolve, the suite of measures included in the budget must adjust."
"These changes are most likely to occur during strategic assessments, with new initiatives, from changes in funding levels or as a result of new legislation."
"Generally, the IRS cannot change or drop measures that have been published in the CJ or Agency Financial Report (AFR) in the middle of a year."
"Division commissioners or heads of office may request revising, adding or dropping performance budget measures by written memorandum to the Associate CFO for Corporate Budget or the CFO."
The Associate CFO for Corporate Budget may also request business units develop new measures to be included in performance reporting.
"Examples of appropriate changes include:
Replacing a quality measure with a new one concurrent with a change in the quality review process."
Adding a measure for a new program or one that is gaining attention and resources.
Eliminating a measure for a program that is being de-emphasized.
Organizations should review their suite of measures periodically to ensure alignment with strategic goals and objectives.
"Changes to Historical (previously published) Performance Data
The IRS cannot make changes to historical data that have been reported in the IRS CJ, the MD&A or the AFR."
"Note: While this section deals exclusively with changes to budget level measures, there may be instances where an organization has requirements to report performance externally for non-budget level measures."
"The same requirements regarding approval, elimination and timing will apply."
All changes must be formally approved by the division commissioner or head of office and communicated to the appropriate office of the external organization.
"Exhibit 1.5.1-1
Questions and Answers about the IRS Balanced Performance Measurement System
Question	Answer
Q1."
How do organizational measures link to individual front-line appraisals?
The IRS bases individual appraisals of front-line employees (non-management officials) on the critical elements for their positions.
The critical elements in some areas reflect the IRS priorities as reflected in the balanced measures.
"All employee standards are evaluated on the retention standard requiring the ""fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."""
"Overall, the IRS must base employee evaluations on a review of actual work performed, judged against elements and standards, with consideration given to the specific facts and circumstances of each case."
Q2.
How do these organizational measures link to individual manager appraisals?
The IRS bases managerial evaluations on the actions taken in accordance with an agreed upon plan and performance standards.
The IRS uses organizational measures as an analytical reference to determine whether the actions taken achieved the desired performance result.
The IRS shall not use these organizational measures to directly determine the evaluation of an individual manager or as a stand-alone evaluative tool.
Q3.
"What guarantees are there in the process to prevent managers from relying on ""numbers?"""
"The IRS expects managers to look not just at the measurement results, but at the facts, circumstances and specific situations in any area that warrants attention."
Additional steps to reinforce the balanced performance measures approach include changes to the review processes and the individual performance management processes.
Q4.
Will the IRS compare numerical results against prior years to assess progress?
Yes.
The IRS will compare performance results with prior year results to assess progress.
This does not mean the IRS will determine a manager’s appraisal by how measures results change over the year.
"The results can change for numerous reasons, many of which are not under the control of the manager."
The actions taken by the manager to improve performance will be what influences the manager’s appraisal.
Q5.
How will the IRS measure customer satisfaction?
The IRS bases the customer satisfaction measure on customer perceptions of the service they receive.
Survey responses provide the basis for identifying areas with the greatest potential for improvement.
Q6.
How will the IRS measure employee satisfaction?
The IRS bases employee satisfaction on the information gathered through the annual Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey or other surveys.
All employees have an opportunity to take the employee survey under conditions that guarantee them anonymity.
Q7.
How will the IRS measure quality in business results?
The IRS generally will base quality on an independent review of closed cases or ongoing case work using systems such as the National Quality Review System.
Q8.
How will the IRS measure quantity in business results?
"Quantity consists of outcome-neutral measures that count outreach activities, or the amount of work completed, such as cases closed."
"The IRS may use results from quantity measures as an input in evaluating the performance of an organizational unit if the evaluation also considers measures of customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and quality, when appropriate."
Q9.
"How will the IRS know when the measures and goals for customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and business results are in balance?"
Each element of the Balanced Performance Measurement System represents an important aspect for assessing progress toward the IRS’s goals.
"Any activity involving balanced measures, such as setting goals, assessing progress and evaluating results, must consider all three elements."
Performance results help shape future plans and strategies for overall performance.
The mix of programs and strategies proposed should cover all three elements.
The purpose of the IRS balanced performance measures approach is to ensure each element gets due consideration.
The IRS must prioritize critical issues and select a mix of strategies and programs aimed at attaining overall progress toward achieving the IRS mission and strategic goals.
Q10.
How will the IRS use the results of performance measures to set budget priorities?
The IRS will use balanced measurement results to assess the effectiveness of strategies and actions undertaken to improve performance and those results will serve as a factor in budget development.
"The IRS will use performance results, detailed analysis of factors affecting program performance and an assessment of existing and emerging trends to determine the appropriate mix of program strategies and allocation of resources necessary to achieve the IRS’s goals."
Q11.
Does the balanced performance measurement system limit organizational units from implementing procedures for prioritizing work or setting standards for certain processes and procedures?
No.
"The IRS does not intend the Balanced Performance Measurement System to limit organizational units from developing work plans, establishing projections for workload indicators, issuing procedures for performing work or setting standards for the prioritization and timeliness of work to ensure efficient workload management and quality service to customers."
The goal of the Balanced Performance Measurement System is to ensure the IRS makes business decisions considering each element of the balanced measures framework.
"Example: When establishing timeliness standards, the organizational unit needs to ensure they have the appropriate resources and are equipped to meet those standards so that they do not affect customer satisfaction and quality."
Q12.
Is it permissible to discuss failure to meet aspects of a work plan or business plan with a manager?
Yes.
"However, the conversation must include a discussion of what factors may have contributed to the manager not being able to meet the plan and what actions the manager took and/or should have taken to rectify the situation."
"There may be a very good reason the IRS did not meet the plan or there may be other circumstances that require a revision to the plan, for example, a reallocation of resources or a change in priorities."
"Finally, during the discussion, be sure to consider and relate the effect of the performance issue being discussed, as well as the effect of potential corrective actions to the balanced measures elements of business results, customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction."
Q13.
Can the IRS tell employees that a service standard for the telephone assistance program is that the IRS should not leave taxpayers on hold for longer than a set number of minutes?
Yes.
"In the interests of customer service and business performance, the IRS needs to establish organizational timeliness standards to support improved service to all customers."
The IRS should base such standards on the level of resources available and the length of time necessary to provide top quality service to each caller.
The agency should not establish standards it cannot meet.
Doing so leads to sacrifices in quality and poor service to customers.
"The focus of any evaluation against timeliness standards should not be on the number, but on the appropriateness of the actions taken."
"In some instances, it will be necessary to leave taxpayers on hold for longer periods of time."
Q14.
Is it permissible to rely on system data or reports to evaluate front-line employees?
"No- with the exception of employees performing measured work (for example, Submission Processing uses the Measured Employee Performance System (MEPS) for frontline employee evaluations)."
"System data, such as talk-time, call histories and sign-on and sign-off times, can serve as diagnostic indicators that point to areas where performance issues may exist."
"The manager needs to address these, and through review and monitoring of the employee's work, determine whether an actual performance problem exists."
"Example: System data alone could suggest a performance problem, but upon further review and monitoring, managers might find a valid or appropriate cause for the system results."
Q15.
Why is cycle time or overage considered a quality measure and not a quantity measure?
"Under the balanced performance measurement system, quantity measures provide information about the amount of work performed and products or services provided."
"Quality measures provide information about the extent that work performed met prescribed standards, including accuracy, timeliness and completeness."
"Therefore, cycle time and overage measures assess the timeliness in which employees complete work."
They do not reveal how much work was completed.
"However, each organizational unit may make its own determination about whether managers may use certain categories of outcome-neutral data in quality or quantity measures."

Exhibit 1.5.1-6
Analyzing Performance Using the Traditional Problem-Solving Model
The IRS may use balanced performance measures and corresponding underlying metrics to identify and understand changes in performance and to identify improvement options."
The Traditional Problem-Solving Model is an approach the IRS has used effectively and has several steps.
"Receive Data
Organizational units obtain data from a variety of sources such as performance results, quality review results and data collected by the Taxpayer Advocate."
"In other instances, organizational units may have to develop data locally."
Organizational units may often repeat this step after they define a problem.
"For example, an initial scan of data, such as survey results, may suggest that a problem exists with customer service and lead to the development of an initial problem statement."
This in turn would require additional data collection to accurately define the problem.
"Define the Problem
In some cases, the problem may be obvious."
"In other cases, you will need to analyze the data to identify the problem."
State the problem in objective terms.
An accurately worded problem statement is important for the other steps in the process.
"Example: “Taxpayers do not have a sufficient understanding of IRS procedures.” Not: “IRS employees are not explaining our procedures sufficiently to taxpayers.”
Determine Potential Causes of the Problem
Determining potential causes requires research."
Look at all the data available to you.
Talk to employees and peers and search for potential causes.
Assess the possible causes.
Don’t jump to conclusions about the solution.
Evaluate causes and prioritize them based upon their effect on the problem.
"Generate Alternative Solutions
Include all involved parties to generate alternatives."
Specify alternatives consistent with organizational goals.
Specify short and long term alternatives.
Brainstorm using others’ ideas.
"Evaluate and Select an Alternative
Evaluate alternatives relative to goals."
Evaluate both proven and possible outcomes.
State the selected alternative explicitly.
"Implement and Follow Up on the Solution
Plan and implement a pilot test of the chosen alternative."
Gather feedback from all affected parties.
Seek acceptance or consensus by those affected.
Establish ongoing measures and monitoring.
Evaluate long-term results based on the final solution.
"Note: In cases where you have no solutions that work, you will need to repeat step (4) Generate Alternative Solutions."
"Alternatively, consider re-evaluating the problem again as sometimes you may not find a solution because the problem definition is not well-defined."

Veterans' Recruitment Appointment
The Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA) is a special authority by which the Service can appoint eligible veterans without competition to positions at any grade level through GS-11 or equivalent."
(The promotion potential of the position is not a factor.)
VRA appointees are hired under excepted appointments to positions that are otherwise in the competitive service.
"There is no limit to the number of VRA appointments an individual may receive, provided the individual is otherwise eligible."
"6.307.1.2.1 (11-03-2023)
VRA Eligibility Requirements and Conditions of Employment
The Jobs for Veterans Act, Public Law 107-288, amended 38 USC 4214 by making a major change in the eligibility criteria for obtaining a VRA."
"Those eligible are:
Disabled veterans as defined by 38 USC 4211
Veterans who served on active duty in the Armed Forces during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized
Veterans who, while serving on active duty in the Armed Forces, participated in a United States military operation for which an Armed Forces Service Medal was awarded pursuant to Executive Order 12985
Veterans separated honorably within the last three years
Veterans claiming eligibility on the basis of service defined in letters b and c above must be in receipt of the appropriate campaign badge, expedition medal, or Armed Forces Service Medal."
"In addition to meeting the criteria above, eligible veterans must have been separated with an honorable or general discharge."
"Under the eligibility criteria, not all five-point preference eligible veterans are eligible for a VRA appointment."
"Example 1 - A veteran who served during the Vietnam era, for more than 180 consecutive days, after January 31, 1955, and before October 15, 1976, but did not receive a service-connected disability or an Armed Forces Service medal or campaign or expeditionary medal would be entitled to five-point veterans’ preference."
"This veteran, however, would not be eligible for a VRA appointment under the above criteria."
"Example 2 - A veteran who served during the Gulf War from August 2, 1990 through January 2, 1992, would be eligible for veterans' preference solely on the basis of that service."
"Service during that time period, in and of itself, does not confer VRA eligibility on the veteran unless one of the above VRA eligibility criteria is met."
"Under the eligibility criteria, not all VRA veterans are eligible for five-point veterans' preference."
"A recently discharged veteran is eligible for VRA, but will not be eligible for veterans’ preference if the period of service is not listed as qualifying for five-point veterans' preference."
VRA eligible applicants who meet the basic qualification requirements for the position to be filled may be appointed without applying through a job announcement.
"However, veterans' preference applies in making appointments under the VRA authority."
"If there are two or more VRA applicants and one or more is eligible for preference, the agency must apply veterans' preference."
An agency must consider all VRA applicants on file who are qualified for the position.
Example - One applicant is a VRA eligible based on receiving an Armed Forces Service Medal (this medal does not confer veterans’ preference eligibility).
The second applicant is VRA eligible based on being a disabled veteran (which does confer veterans’ preference eligibility).
"In this example, both individuals are VRA eligible but only one of them is eligible for Veterans’ preference."
"As a result, agencies must apply the procedures of 5 CFR 302 when considering VRA candidates for appointment."
"A VRA appointee may be promoted, demoted, reassigned, or transferred in the same way as a career employee as defined by 5 CFR 335."
"As with other competitive service employees, the time-in-grade requirement applies to the promotion of VRA’s."
"If a VRA eligible employee is qualified for a higher grade, an agency may, at its discretion, give the employee a new VRA appointment at a higher grade up through GS-11 (or equivalent) without regard to time-in-grade."
"After two years of satisfactory performance and conduct during continuous service, the VRA appointee must be converted to a career or career-conditional appointment, as appropriate."
Employees who do not meet the criteria for conversion to permanent status must be terminated.
Agencies may make a noncompetitive temporary or term appointment based on an individual's eligibility for VRA appointment.
The temporary or term appointment must be at the grades authorized for VRA appointment but is not a VRA appointment itself and does not lead to conversion to career-conditional.
VRA appointees have the appeal rights of excepted service employees.
This means that VRA employees who are preference eligible attain full 5 CFR 302.752 adverse action and 5 CFR 302.432 performance action appeal rights after one year of current continuous service in the same or similar position(s).
VRA’s who are not preference eligible do not get this protection until they have completed two years of current continuous employment in the same or similar position.
"In addition, any individual serving under a VRA whose employment under the appointment is terminated within one year after the date of such appointment, has the same right to appeal that termination as a career or career-conditional employee has during the first year of employment."
"6.307.1.2.2 (11-06-2009)
Accepting VRA Applications
There are three groups of VRA applicants as follows:
Applicants from outside the federal service."
Selecting officials have broad discretion under the personnel laws to hire from several appropriate sources of qualified candidates.
Applicants with noncompetitive appointment eligibility under the VRA authority under 5 CFR 316.302(2) are one such source.
Current IRS VRA appointees.
These employees have the same promotional opportunities and are subject to the same requirements as other employees under the IRS’s merit promotion plan.
Veterans under the VRA Program must be permitted to apply under merit promotion procedures.
This means the IRS must accept applications from its current employees serving under VRA.
Those who meet the promotion requirements and time-in grade are rated and ranked along with status candidates.
"If selected, time previously served can count towards the two-year period for conversion."
Selection does not confer competitive status to the veteran.
Applicants from other federal agencies.
Selecting officials have broad discretion under the personnel laws to hire from several appropriate sources of qualified candidates.
Applicants with noncompetitive appointment eligibility under the VRA authority under 5 CFR 316.302(2) are one such source.
"Under certain conditions such as 10 point veteran preference, VRA applicants from outside the federal service and current IRS VRA appointees have the right to reopen competitive examinations that were open for applications from the public."
"However, the same VRA eligibles, including those with preference, have no right to ""reopen"" a closed promotion announcement to apply after the closing date."
"6.307.1.2.3 (11-03-2023)
Ranking and Referral of VRA Candidates
5 CFR 302, Subpart B and 5 CFR 307 should be followed to ensure that preference is observed for disabled veterans and other veterans entitled to preference."
"Current IRS VRA appointees, like competitive service employees, may apply under an internal merit promotion announcement and are subject to the same requirements."
Current IRS VRA appointees may also apply under an internal merit promotion announcement as a possible VRA-eligible with eligibility to be confirmed by TA in the hiring process.
"All VRA eligible applicants should be listed on a separate certificate in preference order as follows:
10% or more compensable service-connected disability
Other 10 point preference eligible
Five-point preference eligible
Non-preference eligible
Selections must be made from the highest available preference category, as long as there are at least three candidates in that group."
"When fewer than three candidates are in the highest category, consideration may be expanded to include the next category."
The VRA eligible applicants who are not entitled to veterans' preference should be placed in the non-preference category.
"As long as there is one preference eligible on this list, a selection from the non-preference category may not be made unless the justification to pass over the veteran is adjudicated."
There is no requirement to select from this source of applicants.
This is only one of many applicant sources.
A veteran on this list does not block the consideration of other sources.
Selections can be made from certificates that contain different sources of applicants.
"6.307.1.2.4 (11-06-2009)
Training and Education Requirements
If the VRA appointee has less than 15 years of formal education as defined by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the IRS is required to provide a written training program agreement (signed by the veteran) in which the veteran agrees to pursue a training or educational program during the two year employment period."
"If the VRA appointee has 15 years of formal education or more, they may participate in the same training programs as other employees."
A training program could include on-the-job assignments and/or classroom training.
"To ensure that this requirement is met, a written training or educational plan must be developed."
The written training or educational plan should include definitive long and short-range objectives.
Such objectives are necessary to effectively evaluate on-the-job performance and other training participation in the program.
"6.307.1.3 (11-03-2023)
Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998
The Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (VEOA), as amended by Section 511 of the Veterans Millennium Health Care Act, (Public Law 106-117), of November 30, 1999, provides that agencies must allow eligible veterans to apply for positions announced under merit promotion procedures that otherwise only would be available to status candidates when the agency is recruiting from outside its own workforce."
"“Agency” in this context, means the parent agency Treasury, not IRS."
A VEOA eligible who competes under merit promotion procedures and is selected will be given a career or career-conditional appointment.
Veterans' preference is not a consideration in these appointments.
"6.307.1.3.1 (11-06-2009)
VEOA Eligibility Requirements and Conditions of Employment
To be eligible for a VEOA appointment, a veteran must be a preference eligible applicant or veteran separated after three or more years of continuous active service performed under honorable conditions."
Veterans who were released shortly before completing a three-year tour are considered to be initially eligible for VEOA.
"Active service, defined in 37 USC 101, means active duty in the uniformed services and includes full-time training duty, annual training duty, full-time National Guard duty, and attendance while in active service, at a school designated as a service school by law or by the Secretary concerned."
VEOA applicants appointed under the VEOA are subject to a probationary period.
"VEOA applicants appointed after December 30, 1999 in the competitive service have the appeal rights of competitive service employees."
Public Law 106-117(511) will be used as the legal authority for any new appointments under the VEOA.
"6.307.1.3.2 (08-13-2025)
Accepting VEOA Applications
IRS Internal Merit Promotion Vacancy Announcements – Internal merit promotion vacancy announcements, open to IRS or Treasury applicants only, are not required to include application information for VEOA eligibles because the agency is not recruiting outside its own workforce."
"(""Agency,"" in this context, means the parent agency Treasury, not the IRS."
"Career Transition Assistance Plan (CTAP) Announcements – Because CTAP is limited to internal agency candidates, there is no requirement to include application information for VEOA eligible applicants."
"Merit promotion Vacancy Announcements Open to Status Applicants Outside Treasury – Merit promotion vacancy announcements open to status applicants outside of Treasury must accept applications from VEOA eligibles, wherever they are located."
Current federal employees (along with those seeking initial federal employment) with VEOA eligibility can apply for positions opened to status applicants outside of Treasury.
"VEOA does not exempt VEOA eligible federal employees from eligibility criteria, such as time-in-grade restrictions."
"In addition to the standard application instructions on USA Jobs, external merit promotion vacancy announcements must include the following VEOA specific language:
Open to all veterans eligible under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998
Must be a veteran preference eligible under 5 USC 2108(3) or a veteran who substantially completed three or more years of active service under honorable conditions
Must submit a copy of the document DD-214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, as proof of VEOA eligibility
Delegated Examining Unit (DEU) Vacancy Announcement – VEOA eligibles applying under a DEU vacancy announcement (competitive examining process) are treated in the same manner as any other DEU applicant and the following applies:
VEOA eligibility accords no advantage
Veterans' preference applies
VEOA eligible applicants must be within reach on a hiring certificate to be referred on the DEU list of eligibles
Note: When a position is advertised through merit promotion which is open to status applicants outside the agency, and delegated examining using two separate announcements, VEOA eligible applicants who apply for both announcements will receive separate considerations for each vacancy announcement."
"A VEOA eligible may not be removed from either the merit promotion or DEU selection list solely because he or she is being considered through the other announcement
Interagency Career Transition Assistance Plan (ICTAP) Vacancy Announcements – VEOA eligibles may apply for ICTAP announcements."
"When both ICTAP and VEOA eligible applications are received, the ""well qualified"" ICTAP applicant receives priority over the VEOA applicant."
"Once the ICTAP candidate has been cleared, the best qualified VEOA eligible candidate can be considered."
Veterans' preference does not apply in the ranking.
"Announcements must include the following VEOA specific information:
Open to veterans eligible under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998
Must be a veteran preference eligible under 5 USC 2108(3) or a veteran who substantially completed three or more years of active service under honorable conditions
Must submit a copy of the document, DD-214, Certificate of Release or Discharge form Active Duty, as proof of VEOA eligibility
6.307.1.3.3 (11-06-2009)
Ranking and Referral of VEOA Candidates
VEOA applications from external merit promotion announcements open to status applicants outside of Treasury must be rated and ranked with status applicants, using the same assessment criteria."
No distinction is made.
VEOA applicants are referred with status applicants on the same certificate.
VEOA eligible applicants referred for consideration are not guaranteed selection.
The VEOA selectee will be given a career or career-conditional appointment.
A temporary or term appointment may not be offered.
"6.307.1.4 (11-03-2023)
Additional Military Appointment Authorities and Provisions
This section describes the special appointment authority and provisions for hiring those that have performed active military service, are spouses of active military service members, disabled veterans, and actions necessary under the IRS Disabled Veterans Affirmative Action Program (DVAAP)."
"6.307.1.4.1 (11-06-2009)
Disabled Veterans Affirmative Action Program
The IRS encourages and supports the utilization of all available resources to employ and advance disabled veterans."
The Commissioner periodically emphasizes this policy in memoranda and information notices to employees.
The Disabled Veterans Affirmative Action Program (DVAAP) program responsibility resides with the OPM.
All agencies are required to develop a DVAAP Plan.
Treasury's Plan covers all its Bureaus and is published as Appendix B to Chapter 720 of the Treasury Personnel Manual.
It provides for local offices to develop local plans as appropriate.
The IRS DVAAP Plan supplements the Treasury’s plan and provides instructions on responsibilities for affirmative actions to be taken by all offices to promote the employment and advancement of disabled veterans.
"To fully implement their responsibilities, appointing offices may establish and implement local plans."
"6.307.1.4.2 (11-06-2009)
30 percent or More Disabled Veteran
The following describes the special appointment authority under 5 CFR 315.707 used for hiring disabled veterans, and provides instructions for implementing the DVAAP."
"The IRS may offer a noncompetitive temporary appointment of at least 60 days, or a term appointment of more than one year but not more than four years, to any veteran:
Retired from active military service with a disability rating of 30 percent or more
Rated by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) since 1991 or later to include disability determinations from a branch of the Armed Forces at any time, as having a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more."
"There is no grade level limitation for this authority, but the appointee must meet all qualification requirements including any written test requirement."
The employee may be non-competitively converted (without a break in service) to a career or career-conditional appointment at any time during the employee’s temporary or term appointment.
"The appointment can be full-time, part-time, or intermittent."
The initial appointment need not be to the same position as the proposed conversion position.
"6.307.1.4.3 (08-13-2025)
Disabled Veterans Enrolled in a VA Training Program
Disabled veterans eligible for training under the VA vocational rehabilitation program may enroll for training or work experience at an agency under the terms of an agreement between the agency and VA."
"While enrolled in the VA program, the veteran is not a Federal employee for most purposes, but is a beneficiary of the VA.
Training is tailored to the individual’s needs and goals and may be as long as needed."
"If the training is intended to prepare the individual for eventual appointment in the agency and not only to provide work experience, the agency must also ensure that the training will enable the veteran to meet the qualification requirements for the position."
"Upon successful completion, the host agency and VA issues the veteran a Certificate of Training showing the occupational series and grade level of the position for which trained."
The Certificate of Training allows any agency to appoint the veteran noncompetitively under a status quo appointment that may be converted to career or career-conditional at any time.
"Reasonable accommodation assistance, if needed, may be coordinated by the Civil Rights and Compliance Office."
"6.307.1.5 (11-03-2023)
Military Spouse Appointing Authority
The Military Spouse Appointing Authority allows agencies to appoint certain military spouses without using traditional competitive examining procedures."
"Agencies can choose to use this authority when filling competitive service positions on a temporary (not to exceed one year), term (more than one year but not more than four years), or permanent basis."
The authority does not entitle spouses to an appointment over any other applicant and is used at the discretion of the agency.
"In accordance with revised 5 USC 3330(d)(b), the head of an agency may now appoint noncompetitively the spouse of a member of the armed forces on active duty, the spouse of a 100 percent disabled member of the armed forces, or the spouse of a deceased member of the armed forces."
This authority includes all spouses of members of the armed forces on active duty.
"To qualify, spouses do not have to relocate with his or her active duty spouse."
Military spouses may be eligible for consideration under this authority if they meet the conditions listed in 5 CFR 315.612.
Military Spouse Preference is a Department of Defense authority applicable to positions being filled both in the continental United States and at overseas locations.
Agencies are not required to use this hiring authority.
"6.307.1.6 (11-06-2009)
Federal Employees Who Perform Active Military Service and Restoration to Duty
This section covers the rights and obligations of employees and the IRS in connection with leaves of absence or restoration to duty following uniformed service and restoration for employees who sustain compensable injuries."
"6.307.1.6.1 (08-13-2025)
Federal Employees Who Perform Active Military Duty
Current IRS employees who perform active military duty are able to leave his or her employment temporarily with the knowledge that his or her affairs are in order and his or her rights are protected."
"Federal law provides many important rights and benefits, as required by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA)."
"The following addresses rights, benefits, and processing instructions for employees who leave his or her jobs to serve on active duty, either on a voluntary or involuntary basis, in a uniformed service."
"This includes, but is not limited to, active duty, active duty training, initial active duty training, inactive duty training, full-time National Guard duty and a period that a person is absent from employment for the purpose of examination to determine fitness for duty."
"Guidance on Military Service while also a federal employee can be found on the OPM Military Service Site
Before an employee leaves for military duty, he or she must be advised of his or her restoration rights, the process to exercise those rights, the time limitations, employee benefits, appeal rights, and any other obligations."
"A sample letter is shown in Exhibit 6.307.1-1
Employees are not harmed when they leave his or her employment temporarily to perform active military duty."
"The USERRA generally requires the employee be placed on Leave Without Pay (LWOP) when entering the military, unless they choose to be placed on military leave or annual leave, as appropriate, or the employee requests to be separated."
"The Department of Labor, Veterans' Employment and Training Service, has issued comprehensive guidance as mandated by USERRA on the DOL website."
"6.307.1.6.2 (08-13-2025)
Rights and Benefits
See IRM 6.630.1, IRS Absence and Leave, for additional guidance on absence and leave."
Permanent or temporary federal employee.
Federal employees who are called to active duty (or volunteer for active duty) are entitled to the rights and benefits contained in this subsection.
Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs).
EAPs can be very helpful to employees and their families in coping with the stress and disruption associated with a call to active military duty.
"EAPs provide short-term counseling and referral services to help with financial, emotional, and dependent care problems."
These services are available to employees who are family members of those who are performing active military duty.
"In addition, many EAPs offer services to family members of employees."
Pay.
Employees performing active military duty receive compensation from the Armed Forces in accordance with the terms and conditions of his or her military enlistment or commission.
"They do not receive any compensation from his or her civilian-employing agency unless they elect to use military leave or annual leave as described in paragraphs five and eight, below."
"Agencies should continue the payment of availability pay for criminal investigators and annual premium pay for administratively uncontrollable overtime work, or regularly scheduled standby duty, on days of military leave or annual leave."
Military Leave.
"Employees who perform active military duty may request paid military leave, as specified in 5 USC 6323(a)."
"Under the law, an eligible full-time employee accrues 15 days (120 hours) of military leave each fiscal year."
"In addition, an employee may carry over up to 15 days (120 hours) of unused military leave from one fiscal year to the next."
"When the 15 days of military leave that are carried over are combined with the 15 days of military leave accrued at the beginning of the new fiscal year, this produces a maximum military leave benefit of 30 days in a fiscal year."
These extra days of carry over military leave must be used in the new fiscal year to avoid forfeiting since an employee cannot carry over more than 15 calendar days to the next fiscal year.
Part-time career employees accrue military leave on a prorated basis.
"Employees who elect to use military leave will receive full compensation from his or her civilian position for each hour charged to military leave, in addition to his or her military pay for the same period."
Military leave can only be charged for hours the employee would have worked and does not apply to weekends and other non-workdays.
"Additional information on charging military leave can be found on the OPM website at: OPM Military Leave Fact Sheet Employees who perform active military duty may be granted an additional 22 days of military leave under 5 USC 6323(b) for emergency duty as ordered by the President, Secretary of Defense, or a State Governor."
This leave is granted for the purpose of providing military duty in support of civil authorities in the protection of life and property or who perform full-time military service as a result of a call or order to active duty in support of a contingency operation as defined in 10 USC 101(a)(13).
Annual Leave.
"Employees who perform active military duty may request the use of his or her personally accrued annual leave balance (under 5 USC 6303 and 6304), and such requests must be granted by the agency."
Requests for advanced annual leave may be granted at the agency’s discretion.
"In addition to his or her military pay, employees who use annual leave will receive compensation from his or her civilian position for all hours charged to annual leave for the same period."
LWOP.
"USERRA generally requires an agency to place an employee reporting for uniformed service on LWOP unless the employee chooses to be placed on military leave or annual leave, as appropriate, or the employee requests to be separated."
Full-time employees do not earn annual or sick leave in a pay period in which they have accumulated 80 hours of LWOP.
"In addition, part-time employees on LWOP also earn less annual and sick leave, since they earn leave based on the number of hours in a pay status."
Lump-Sum Leave Payments.
Employees who enter into active military duty may choose to have his or her annual leave balance maintained until they return to his or her civilian position or they may receive a lump-sum payment for all accrued and accumulated annual leave.
"However, an agency must make a lump-sum payment for any restored annual leave under 5 USC 6304(d)."
There is no requirement to separate from a civilian position in order to receive a lump-sum leave payment under 5 USC 5552.
"When an employee who has been on military duty returns to active federal service prior to the end of the period covered by the lump-sum payment, the employee must refund an amount equal to the pay that covers the period between the date of reemployment and the expiration of the lump-sum leave period."
Agencies may not re-credit any restored annual leave to the employee’s leave account.
"Further guidance on the repayment of a lump-sum payment for annual leave can be found at: OPM Military Lump-Sum Leave Payment
Health Benefits."
"Employees who are absent from duty due to service in the uniformed services (active duty or active duty for training beyond 30 days) may elect to have his or her health insurance coverage continue for up to 24 months, and the employee continues to pay his or her share of the premium."
"Employees who remain in the uniformed services beyond 12 months may continue his or her health insurance for an additional 12 months by paying 102 percent of the premium, composed of: the employee’s share, the government’s share, and a two percent administrative fee."
Employees are entitled to a free 31 day extension of coverage during which they can convert to a non-group policy.
These employees are not eligible for TCC (Temporary Continuation of Coverage).
"If an employee does not wish to continue the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) coverage while he/she is in non-pay status, the employee can elect in writing to have the FEHB coverage terminated (the employee is still entitled to the free 31 day extension and the right to convert)."
"When an employee who has been on military duty returns to active federal service, he or she can enroll in a FEHB plan within 60 days of the return to service, (as long as the position is not excluded from coverage)."
Life Insurance.
Employees who are put in a non-pay status while on military duty can keep his or her Federal Employee’s Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) coverage for up to 12 months.
This coverage is free.
"At the end of 12 months in non-pay status, the coverage terminates."
"If the employee separates from federal civilian service, FEGLI coverage continues for up to 12 months or 90 days after uniformed service ends, whichever is sooner."
"Employees who enter on active duty or active duty for training in one of the uniformed services for more than 30 days can elect to continue his or her FEGLI coverage for an additional 12 months, for a total of 24 months."
These employees must pay both the employee and agency share of premiums for his or her Basic coverage and pay the entire cost (there is no agency share) for any Optional insurance for the additional 12 months of coverage.
"For employees who elect to continue FEGLI coverage for the additional 12 month period, FEGLI coverage terminates at the end of the 24 month period or 90 days after military service ends, whichever comes first."
"For employees who elect to not continue FEGLI coverage for the additional 12 month period, FEGLI coverage terminates at the end of the original 12 month period or 90 days after military service ends, whichever comes first."
Federal employees with FEGLI who are called to active duty retain and have the same entitlements; death benefits are payable to the employee’s beneficiaries.
"Accidental death and dismemberment benefits are also payable under Basic insurance (and Option A, if the employee had that coverage) unless the employee was in actual combat at the time."
Accidental death benefits are in addition to regular death benefits.
"Even if accidental death benefits are not payable, regular death benefits are payable."
"When an employee who has been on military duty returns to active federal service, the employee resumes the same life insurance they had before going into non-pay status (as long as the position is not excluded from coverage)."
"When an employee’s FEGLI coverage terminates, the employee receives a free 31 day temporary extension of coverage to allow the employee to find new life insurance."
Retirement.
An employee who is placed in a LWOP status while performing active military duty continues to be covered by either the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS).
Death benefits will be paid as if he or she were still in the civilian position.
"If the employee becomes disabled for his or her civilian position during the LWOP period and has the minimum amount of civilian service necessary for disability benefits (five years for CSRS, 18 months for FERS), the employee will become entitled to disability benefits under the retirement law."
"Upon eventual retirement from civilian service, the period of military service is creditable under either CSRS or FERS, subject to the rules for crediting military service."
"If an employee separates to enter active military duty, he or she generally will receive retirement credit for the period of separation when the employee exercises restoration rights to his or her civilian position."
"If the separated employee does not exercise the restoration right, but later reenters federal civilian service, the military service may be credited under the retirement system, subject to the rules governing credit for military service."
"However, if an employee covered by CSRS is separated to enter active military duty during a period of war or national emergency (as declared by Congress or proclaimed by the President), the employee is deemed not to be separated from his or her civilian position for retirement purposes (unless the employee applies for and receives a refund of his or her retirement deductions)."
Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).
"Federal civilian personnel who are also in the military may contribute to TSP up to the maximum allowable contribution, both as a member of the uniformed service and as a federal civilian employee."
Enrollment into a uniformed service TSP account must be done through the uniformed services’ personnel office.
"The uniformed service account will be maintained separately from the civilian account, and contributions to the uniformed service account can only be made from uniformed service pay."
"Similarly, contributions to the civilian account can only be made from civil service compensation."
"Once separated from either the uniformed service or federal civilian service, TSP accounts can be combined."
Specific information on the TSP rules governing uniformed service can be found at: TSP.
"Additional provisions may apply to employees covered under USERRA such as: the ability to make up missed TSP contributions, entitlement to 1% agency matching contributions, and the ability to pause TSP loan repayment."
More information is available on these provisions at: TSP.
Return to Civilian Duty.
"An employee who enters active military duty (voluntary or involuntary) from any position, including a temporary position, has full job protection as covered under USERRA provided they apply for reemployment."
"The following time limits and stipulations apply to USERRA:
Employees who served less than 31 days must report back to work at the beginning of the next scheduled workday following his or her release from service and the expiration of eight hours after a time for safe transportation back to the employee’s place of residence
Employees who served more than 30 days but less then 181 days, must apply for reemployment within 14 days of release by the military
Employees who served less than 91 days must be restored to the position for which they are qualified and would have attained had his or her employment not been interrupted."
"Employees who served more than 90 days have essentially the same rights, except that the agency has the option of placing the employee in a position for which he or she qualifies that is of like seniority, status, and pay to the position the employee would have attained had his or her employment not been interrupted
Employees who served more than 180 days have 90 days to apply for reemployment
Upon return or restoration, an employee generally is entitled to be treated as though he or she had never left for purposes of rights and benefits based upon length of service."
"This means that the employee must be considered for career ladder promotions, and the time spent in the military will be credited for seniority, successive within-grade increases, probation, career tenure, annual leave accrual rate, and severance pay."
"An employee who was on a temporary appointment serves out the remaining time, if any, left on the appointment."
"(the military activation period does not extend the civilian appointment)
An employee performing active military duty is protected from reduction in force (RIF) and may not be discharged from employment for a period of one year following separation (six months in the case of a Reservist called to active duty under 10 USC 12304 for more than 30 days, but less than 181 days, or ordered to an initial period of active duty for training of not less than 12 consecutive weeks), except for poor performance or conduct or for suitability reasons
Appeal Rights."
An employee or former employee of an agency in the executive branch who is entitled to restoration in connection with military duty may appeal an agency’s failure to properly carry out the law with the DOL.
"Alternatively, the employee can appeal directly to Merit System Protection Board (MSPB) if they chose not to file with the DOL or they are informed by either DOL or the Office of the Special Counsel that they will not pursue to the case."
Further information and applicable time limits are contained in the USERRA appeals regulations in 38 USC 4323 and 5 CFR 1208.
Note: National Guard technicians do not have the right to appeal to MSPB a denial of reemployment rights by the Adjutant General.
Technicians may file complaints with the appropriate district court in accordance with 38 USC 4323.

Death benefits will be paid as if still in the civilian position.
"If you become disabled during LWOP and you have the minimum amount of civilian service necessary for title to disability benefits, you will become entitled to disability benefits under the retirement law."
"Upon eventual retirement from civil service, your period of military service is creditable under either CSRS or FERS, subject to the rules for crediting military service."

OPM Training and Development
(1) Training and Development guidelines published by OPM, serves as a single reference to legal information impacting employee training."
This guidance may be accessed through the OPM website at: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/training-and-development/.
(2) The guidance covers the essential legal information needed for human resource development professionals and managers to make decisions on the management and implementation of training programs for agency personnel.
"(3) Specifically, it highlights important legal references and citations from documents such as:

Public Law

Executive Orders

OMB Budget and Procurement Guidelines

6.410.1.2.3 (10-30-2016)
Legal and Regulatory Basis for Training
(1) Training is defined in Title 5 of the United States Code as the process of providing employees the programs, courses, or other instruction they need to improve their individual performance."
"Title 5, Chapter 41, makes clear that the primary purpose of training individual employees is to improve overall organizational performance and to assist in achieving agencies’ missions and performance goals."
For more information see http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/4101.
(2) Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations (5 CFR 410.101-410.202) states an agency’s strategic planning process must include the provision of mission-related training and development.
"""Mission-related training"" is defined as training that completes any of the following:

Supports the agency's strategic plan and performance objectives;

Improves an employee's current job performance;

Allows for expansion or enhancement of an employee's current job;

Enables an employee to perform needed or potentially needed duties outside the current job at the same level of responsibility; and

Meets organizational needs in response to human resource plans and re-engineering, downsizing, restructuring, or program changes."
"(3) In order to meet the statutory requirement that training will assist in improving organizational performance, all course development projects, including the procurement of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) training products, must be preceded by an analysis that accomplishes all of the following:

Identifies and specifically defines the required performance level for the target employee population;

Describes the current gap between desired and actual employee performance; and

Documents that training will be effective in closing the performance gap."
"(4) The complexity of this analysis will vary and may be relatively informal, depending on such factors as the existence of prior performance data."
"At a minimum, a written statement or summary of the analysis process should be developed and maintained in the course development files."
The analysis helps to prevent resources from being wasted on development of training that will be ineffective.
Course developers and managers should refer to the Training Development Quality Assurance System (TDQAS) documents for additional guidance on conducting this analysis.
Also see IRM Section 6.410.1.2.1.2.
"6.410.1.2.4 (04-23-2019)
Quality Assurance Support Plan
(1) Per Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations (5 CFR 410.202), agencies must evaluate their training programs annually to determine how well such plans and programs contribute to mission accomplishment and meet organizational performance goals."
(2) The IRS uses a process to measure data that improves Servicewide Learning and Education (SL&E)products and services.
"The IRS identifies performance requirements and standards for Mission Critical Occupations, other Key Occupations and Front line Leadership courses."
The process is called the Quality Assurance Support Plan or QASP.
"(3) QASP consists of 7 categories, with performance requirements related to training:

Planning- Develop an annual training plan for development and delivery, by September 15th each year."
Budget- Report on Servicewide adherence to the use of internal order codes for training expenditures.
"Evaluation- Analyze Level 1, 2 and 3 assessment results for training effectiveness."
Design/Development- Follow TDQAS Instructional design model.
Delivery- Timely provide instructor observation results; and timely closure of scheduled offerings in ELMS.
Systems- Notify users of scheduled maintenance and system downtime of Servicewide Training Events Tracking System (STETS).
Policy and Standards- Timely update of Items data fields in ELMS; and timely update of Scheduled Offering data fields in the Electronic Learning Management System (ELMS).
(4) QASP will be used to ensure that systematic quality assurance methods are used in the administration of training programs and in the delivery of the training classes.
(5) Business units will perform in accordance to each applicable QASP performance requirement and standard.
(6) Corrective actions will be taken when the program’s performance deviates from established performance requirements.
(7) All education community components must maintain documentation supporting the actions and decisions used to meet QASP performance requirements and standards.
"6.410.1.2.4.1 (04-23-2019)
Planning
(1) Business units and Leadership, Education and Delivery Services (LEADS) will develop an Annual Training Plan based on training needs and budget for the following fiscal year as required by IRM 6.410.1.2.14 and Executive Order 11348."
The plan will cover a 12-month period of October 1 through September 30.
"The training plan will be completed, approved and submitted for posting in the Servicewide Training and Event Tracking System (STETS)."
"All first quarter events must be added to STETS by the 1st business day of July and should include all October, November and December events."
The complete training plan is due by September 15th.
Each plan will include the events and development elements shown in the table below.

"(2) Upon receipt of the Scheduled Offering Required Value Report, CDS and business units will correctly update erroneous and/or incomplete data fields in ELMS within one month."
"6.410.1.2.5 (04-23-2019)
(IRS) Learning and Education Goals
(1) The overall goal of the IRS Learning and Education program is to create an environment to optimize employee learning, skills, and performance in the IRS."
(2) The IRS continues to grow as a learning organization.
Learning organizations work persistently to expand the capacity of their employees to create desired results and to nurture new and expansive patterns of thinking.
"To become a learning organization, training must become embedded in employees’ daily activities and work tasks rather than being delivered only through periodic, formal classes."
Training modules and performance support systems must be available whenever the individual employee needs them.
The most effective delivery method will be determined with a focus on blended learning.
"(3) The Service must continue to promote the development and delivery of courses through training methods such as eLearning an alternative to classroom training, which will contribute to the IRS goal of becoming a learning organization."
The IRS has an eLearning strategy that will utilize technology to promote the acquisition and sharing of knowledge and expertise efficiently and effectively; thereby supporting critical business outcomes and the subsequent creation of a learning organization.
"(4) Benefits from transitioning to eLearning:

More consistency in training

Just-in-time, just enough training

Potential for prescriptive, customized training

Travel time reduced

Expanded opportunities for training to a wider audience at no additional cost

Fewer training funds are used for training travel which provides opportunities to reallocate funds to develop more learning solutions and to create more efficient learning opportunities for more employees."
"(5) The second goal of the IRS Learning and Education program is to enable the education community to design, develop and deliver learning content that is reusable and publishable in any medium, providing maximum flexibility to meet the learning needs of the Service."
"6.410.1.2.6 (04-23-2019)
Learning and Education Governance
(1) The Learning and Development Executive Council (LDEC) provides executive direction, oversight, and support for the development of education programs, including strong front-line and senior leadership, within the IRS to meet the challenges of today as well as build and lead the organization of the future."
The Council also provides advice on executive leadership issues.
"The Council will review and approve Servicewide learning policies, standards, and operating procedures that support the Service’s mission and strategic goals which include:

Creating a vision champions a strong leadership philosophy and vision for effective leadership training and development, including coaching and mentoring across the service;

Ensuring that leadership identification and development processes align with the Servicewide vision;

Ensuring a strategic approach to training;

Promoting a Servicewide culture of learning and self-development;

Ensuring training programs and activities (leadership, technical and cross-functional) meet immediate and future needs Servicewide;

Ensuring training expenditures support the Service’s mission and balanced corporate strategic approach to learning and education goals;

Promoting new and innovative learning processes and solutions; and

Ensuring compliance of Servicewide learning policies, standards and operating procedures and training plan."
"(2) Selected executives serve as a Talent Review Board (TRB) for the Service, holding separate meetings twice yearly at a minimum to provide developmental assignments for high potential leaders, particularly in the Executive Readiness (XR) Program, and to support Geographic Leadership Communities (GLCs) activities."
"The TRB will convene an ad hoc advisory business unit comprised of an executive from each business unit to act on issues related to XR, as needed."
(3) The Servicewide Training Advisory Council (STAC) is a subset of the LDEC.
"Facilitated by the Director, Leadership, Education and Delivery Services (LEADS), the Council:

Reviews, analyzes and recommends training priorities for the annual Servicewide Training Plan."
"Supports the IRS in meeting the requirements of Treasury Directive 12-70 to minimize event-related costs and ensures expenditures are properly reviewed, justifiable and necessary to fulfill the vision and mission of the IRS."
"6.410.1.2.7 (04-23-2019)

Planning for Employee Development
(1) Title 5 CFR 410.303 states that employees are responsible for self-development, for successfully completing and applying authorized training, and for fulfilling continued service agreements."
"In addition, they share their agency's responsibility to identify training needed to improve individual and organizational performance and identify methods to meet those needs, effectively and efficiently."
IRS and individual responsibilities are found in the IRS National Agreement in Article 30.
"(2) To achieve the mission and goals of the organization, employees will need to continue developing as self-directed learners."
"Self-directed learning is a process in which individual employees:

Take the initiative, with or without the help of others, to identify their individual learning needs;

Develop their learning goals;

Identify material resources for learning;

Choose and implement appropriate learning strategies; and

Evaluate their learning outcomes."
(3) Managers are responsible for assisting their employees in identifying and addressing developmental needs.
"Management may support an employee’s development through a variety of methods, including:

Arranging for assignments or developmental details that the manager and employee agree will provide needed knowledge and skills;

Providing IRS-owned or licensed course materials and other references (e.g., books, videos, computer-based training materials, etc.)"
"for study at work or home;

Providing official time, leave without pay, adjusted work hours, or annual leave as appropriate to complete agreed-upon developmental activities; and

Arranging for attendance at appropriate in-service and outservice courses, meetings, and conferences, if management determines that these opportunities will enhance individual and organizational performance, and funding is available."
"(4) If a manager determines that an employee must complete certain training courses or activities to acquire or improve skills needed to perform current or mandatory duties, then the manager must provide the employee official time to complete the developmental activities."
"These activities may include assembled classes, self-study courses, or developmental assignments and other activities."
(5) Employees are also encouraged to pursue self-development for potential future positions or assignments.
"In accordance with Title 5 of the United States Code, a manager’s decision to support an employee’s self-development plans using any of the means listed in (3) above must always be based on the degree to which the manager believes the employee’s newly acquired experience, knowledge, or skills will enhance organizational performance or meet one of the agency’s mission-related goals."
"(6) If time, budget, or other resources are limited, first priority is to support mandatory training as discussed in (4) above, before other employee self-developmental activities."
"(7) Managers may not allow employees to take training materials of a sensitive nature home to complete, either to acquire mandatory skills or for self-development."
IRS software should not be loaded on personally-owned equipment.
Software licenses are purchased for use on IRS equipment.
"By installing IRS software on a personally-owned computer, the IRS is deprived of that license."
See IRM 10.8.27.
"6.410.1.2.10.1 (10-30-2016)
Continuing Professional Education (CPE)

"The three dimensions of CPE are:

Update training - the continuing effort to maintain and update an existing level of proficiency by keeping current on new developments in legislation, regulations, rulings, court cases, and internal procedures, as well as new developments in technology."
"Gap training – the continuing effort to fill knowledge and skill gaps with expertise not acquired, or needed at earlier stages of a career."
Depth training – the continuing effort to concentrate on specific subject matter areas by acquiring detailed knowledge and skill where previous basic training provided awareness level of training.
"(2) The planning, development, and delivery (classroom, blended or web based) of CPE will vary depending on the needs of the target audience."
(3) CPE scheduling is found in the annual training plan of each business unit in the fiscal year it is offered.
"(4) CPE program management includes:

(12) Online programs that are designated with a time frame must be completed within one year of registration.
"6.410.1.2.16.3 (10-30-2016)
Purchase Card
(1) Some local training offices authorize, or require, use of the Purchase Card to pay for training in conjunction with the SF-182 process."
"The micro purchase threshold for training expenses is $3,500 or less."
"Micro purchases can be made using the Purchase Card, Convenience Check, or a Purchase Order."
"(2) The Purchase Card is a means to expedite procurement, and it is normally the preferred method of paying for goods and services within the cardholder’s authorized limit."
"The maximum allowable single transaction limit is $3,500."
It is prohibited to split purchases to circumvent the micro purchase limit.
(3) Processing of the SF-182 is still required to obtain training even if the Purchase Card is used for payment.
Purchase Card users must take a mandatory training class and comply with the rules for its use.
"(4) If the Purchase Card will be used for payment, write, ""Purchase Card buy,"" in the billing data block on the SF-182 to avoid duplicate payments."
"When the Purchase Card is used, the cardholder will enter the purchase in the purchase card log in IPS, and reconcile the log entry when the transaction posts."
"6.410.1.2.16.4 (10-30-2016)
Competitive Quotes
(1) A competitive quote is not required if the price quoted is considered reasonable and is $3,500 or less."

"6.410.1.3.1 (10-30-2016)
Training Development Quality Assurance System (TDQAS)
(1) To ensure the development of quality training, the IRS uses an instructional design model that guides the process of training assessment, analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation."
"This model is called the ""Training Development Quality Assurance System,"" or TDQAS."
"(2) TDQAS consists of six phases, with related actions, that describe the course development process:

Assessment - Identify the performance problems and determine the focus of training development efforts."
"Analysis - Describe the trainee population, inventory the job tasks, select the tasks for training, analyze the tasks, and conduct a learning analysis."
"Design - Design the training plan, construct the test items, prescribe the course design strategy, prescribe the OJT design strategy, prescribe the job aid design strategy, and prescribe the evaluation strategy."
"Development - Develop the draft materials, try out the draft materials, revise and produce the materials."
"Implementation - Implement the training tracking system, prepare the training program guidelines, and oversee training implementation."
"Evaluation - Evaluate learner reaction and achievement, and evaluate job performance and organizational impact."
"(3) When time and funding permit, use the recommended TDQAS phases and steps rather than shortcut or default procedures."
(4) The TDQAS model applies to all methods and media of training development and delivery.
The TDQAS model also applies when a contractor is used to develop a course.
TDQAS can be used as an aid when preparing specifications in a Statement of Work (SOW).
(5) All education community components must maintain documentation supporting the outcomes used to develop curricula and learning content as well as master copies of learning content.
"6.410.1.3.1.1 (04-23-2019)
Assessment
(1) The actions associated with the Assessment phase of TDQAS are to:

Identify the performance problem."
The discrepancy between actual job performance and desired job performance.
"Performance problems may include inadequate performance of experienced employees, changed job responsibilities employees cannot yet perform, new technology affecting job performance, or newly selected employees who lack the necessary job skills."
Determine the focus of training development efforts.
"6.410.1.3.1.2 (10-30-2016)
Analysis
(1) The actions associated with the analysis phase of TDQAS are:

Describe the trainee population."
The trainee population description verifies or revises the assumptions concerning the intended learner audience.
Comprehensive knowledge about the trainees for whom instruction is intended helps developers to design training which will enable the trainees to learn effectively.
"In addition to demographic information which is useful in establishing the scope of training programs, trainee population data provide further information concerning existing skills, knowledge, and attitudes among trainees."
Training can be geared to the trainees and can build on what they already know.
Preliminary training can be offered to those who do not possess prerequisite knowledge and skills.
Differences among trainees can be identified and compensated for in the training design.
This helps ensure that all trainees benefit from the instruction.
Failure to identify existing trainee knowledge and skills may lead to unnecessary overtraining or insufficient training.
"This, in turn, can lead to student boredom, frustration, or even failure."
Trainee population data are routinely referred to throughout the various phases of TDQAS.
Inventory the job tasks.
"For training development purposes it is crucial not only to define the job thoroughly, but also to specify all of the tasks which are components of the job."
These tasks represent all of the possible targets upon which training programs could focus.
This provides the basis for the match-up between job tasks and the requisite training programs which lead to successful job performance.
Failure to produce an accurate task inventory can result in voids in training or in training the wrong tasks.
This negatively affects job accomplishment.
Select the tasks for training.
"Under real-world conditions, not all tasks associated with a particular occupation or specialty can be, or need to be, formally trained."
"This is partially due to shortages of resources, time available for training, the nature of the tasks themselves, and other factors."
"Even if resources were available, it would not be a prudent strategy considering retention and career progression variables."
"It is desirable, therefore, to provide for economy of training by reducing the number of tasks to those necessary or critical to accomplishment of the job."
"During the task selection process, tasks are selected which require formal training, on-the-job training, or can be performed using job aids."
Tasks which do not require training are eliminated.
Analyze the tasks.
Task analysis for training purposes is the process of examining each task selected for training in the circumstances under which it is performed.
This provides information which will assist in the design and development of performance-oriented training.
"A properly prepared task analysis will save countless hours by avoiding duplication of effort among designers, writers, and producers."
"Even more important, this common analysis base provides consistency and continuity among various training products and programs."
"The analysis may also be used to identify common training among occupations — opportunities for generic modules, merger training, etc."
The goal is to ensure that the trainee is trained under conditions that accurately reflect job performance and which will result in job proficiency.
Conduct a learning analysis.
This is the last action of the analysis phase and is preliminary to the actual design of the training and training support materials.
"Based on the task analysis data, this is where specific training objectives are written; the requisite knowledge and skills are determined; and the job aids are confirmed."
"Special emphasis should be placed on job aids, as this may decrease the need for formal courses of instruction."
"6.410.1.3.1.3 (10-30-2016)
Design
(1) The actions associated with the design phase of TDQAS are:

Design the training plan."
The training plan can also be viewed as a training strategy or curriculum.
"The training plan, once developed, serves as the master plan for all training activities within an occupation."
It is the specific training picture or scheme for each occupation within the function.
It is here that overlapping or redundant training objectives can be eliminated and gaps in the training programs can readily be identified.
The training plan provides the structure for coordinated and efficient training development activities by streamlining and integrating courses of instruction to provide the right training at the right time in the right amount.
Construct the test items.
"Test items (not to be confused with the test instruments themselves), whether used in a formal testing scenario, as drill and practice, as practical exercises, or as some other form of learning assessment, measure whether a trainee has achieved a training objective to some standard or degree of proficiency."
They are derived from an analysis of what is required to successfully perform a particular task on the job.
Prescribe the course design strategy.
"The course design strategy provides the guidelines for group-instruction and self-instruction which are conducted in a classroom, learning center, or job setting."
The strategy is prepared before extensive writing or costly production begins.
It is the recipe or blueprint for learning that has been prepared by the training developer that all writers and production specialists can ultimately follow.
This is especially helpful when using task forces or outside contractors to arrive at a clear understanding of how the course is to be developed.
Prescribe the On-the-Job Training (OJT) design strategy.
This provides the link between classroom training and on-the-job performance.
"The OJT design strategy is carefully planned so that the OJT program is organized around important, job-related issues and activities."
OJT activities and assignments are logically and optimally arranged to facilitate the learning process in a job setting.
"Without an OJT design strategy, there is a high probability for a mismatch between objectives, learning activities, and practice."
Follow-on training to enhance or expand upon what was learned in the classroom may be inconsistent among trainees unless it is properly designed.
Prescribe the job aid design strategy.
"Job aids, unless they require training for effective use, are usually faster to develop, less expensive and easier to revise."
"Nevertheless, they must be carefully planned."
"In terms of improving job performance, job aids can decrease the amount of time required to complete a task, reduce the number of errors, and increase the confidence of an employee in his or her ability to do the job by eliminating unnecessary memorization."
Prescribe the evaluation strategy.
"The primary purpose for evaluation in a training context is to gather credible data for improving training which should, in turn, lead to improved job performance."
Planning for evaluation cannot wait until the last minute.
Commitment by SL&E and other involved parties to the evaluation process should be obtained in advance.
This minimizes the chances of evaluation being perceived as threatening.
Resources necessary to the evaluation can be identified early on to facilitate the whole process.
"6.410.1.3.1.4 (10-30-2016)
Development
(1) The actions associated with the development phase of TDQAS are:

Develop the draft materials."
"Development is the logical follow-on to assessment, analysis, and design activities."
"Draft materials provide the opportunity for multiple sources of input to the training program materials, as well as serve as a checks and balances mechanism for minimizing errors."
Try out the draft materials as appropriate.
This tests whether or not the training materials teach.
Tryout of draft materials should not be bypassed.
"The process contributes significantly toward successful training programs and, ultimately, job performance."
Studies have shown that even a limited number of tryout participants can identify 75-80% of the errors and shortcomings in the materials.
Revise and produce the materials.
This is the logical conclusion of the development phase.
"The training and training support materials should now be effective, efficient, educationally sound, and ready for distribution."
"6.410.1.3.1.5 (10-30-2016)
Implementation
(1) The actions associated with the implementation phase of TDQAS are:

Implement the training tracking system."
This action is the link between the produced materials and their implementation.
"It concerns the administration and logistics of cataloging, warehousing, and distributing the training and training support materials."
"In addition, mechanisms for tracking trainees (for training evaluation purposes) during and subsequent to the conduct of instruction should be addressed."
"The training tracking system enters the training and training support materials ""into the system"" so that actual implementation of training programs can occur."
Enter course information into the Enterprise Learning Management System at: https://elms.web.irs.gov/ in accordance with ELMS procedures.
Oversee Training Implementation.
"The purpose is to enable trainers how to teach, set up the classroom (either virtual or face-to-face), obtain the training materials, prepare to conduct training, assemble the trainees, conduct the training, and initiate the evaluation process."
Training implementation is a shared responsibility between LEADS Centralized Delivery Services (CDS) and embedded Learning and Education.
"6.410.1.3.1.6 (10-30-2016)
Evaluation
(1) The actions associated with the Evaluation phase of TDQAS are:

Evaluate learner reaction and achievement."
Learner reaction determines how people feel about the training.
"Learner reaction, also known as Level 1 feedback, answers the question: Did they like it?"
This is the lowest level of a comprehensive approach to evaluation and should never stop here.
Learner achievement is known as Level 2 feedback.
"As a continuation of the process, learner achievement determines whether trainees learned the skills and acquired the knowledge as a result of the training."
Did the participants learn what they were supposed to learn?
These two aspects of the evaluation process provide a basis for deciding whether the training met its planned objectives.
It helps remove guesswork from training programs by obtaining hard data upon which to base revision efforts.
Evaluate Job Performance and Organizational Achievement.
Evaluating job performance is known as Level 3 feedback.
"In a training context, evaluation of job performance determines whether trainees used the knowledge and skills they were taught while on the job."
What do they do differently as a result of training?
Evaluation of organizational impact is known as Level 4 feedback.
"Also in the training context, evaluation of organizational impact determines whether organizational outcomes were influenced/accomplished by the training program."
Did the training program impact the mission of the organization?
These two final aspects of evaluation help to enhance job proficiency by removing guesswork from the training program when hard data are used as a basis for revision efforts.
Failure to determine training impact on job performance allows training deficiencies to remain undetected.
Evaluating the link between training programs and subsequent job performance establishes the accountability of training to the organizational mission.
"6.410.1.3.2 (10-30-2016)
Enterprise Learning Management System (ELMS)
(1) ELMS, the Enterprise Learning Management System is the official system of record for recording and tracking training data for the IRS, and is recognized by OPM and the Treasury Department."
"ELMS is a web based application that managers, employees, and the L&E community access from their desktop computers to manage training and employee development."
"Employees can also access and launch web based training directly from ELMS (Refer to IRM 6.410.8, Learning and Education, Learning Technology Office Standards)."
Access the ELMS website at: http://elms.web.irs.gov/.
"6.410.1.3.2.1 (10-30-2016)
Curriculum Guides and Learning Catalogs
(1) The business units can use curriculum guides to determine necessary training for various occupations."
The curriculum information is loaded into ELMS and subsequently assigned into employee learning plans.
"For additional information, employees can contact their business unit point of contact."
"(2) A competency-based curriculum guide:

Identifies the tasks performed in each occupation and occupational specialty, and

Specifies the training courses that provide the knowledge and skills necessary to perform each task."
"(3) The curriculum guide may be used as a blueprint for:

Planning the training of new employees;

Planning the supplemental and developmental training of more experienced employees; and

Identifying and remedying job performance weaknesses."
(4) The L&E Embedded organizations are responsible for developing course curricula for the occupations included in their business organizations.
"6.410.1.3.3 (10-30-2016)
Identifying Course Development Projects
(1) This information is intended to provide only general guidance."
Specific responsibilities and actions related to the need for course development projects are determined by the needs of the business unit.
(2) Embedded L&E organizations work with their customers to identify organizational training needs.
"Factors to consider include:

Recruiting levels

Attrition rates

Seasonal versus permanent employee groups

The rollout of new operating programs

The application of new technologies

(4) Embedded L&E organizations in partnership with their business unit customers determine which existing courses should be updated or revised and which new courses should be developed based on the annual training plan."
"6.410.1.3.4 (10-30-2016)
Learning Content Management System (LCMS)
(1) The Learning Content Management System (LCMS) is the IRS’s approved system for creating web based training for use in the Enterprise Learning Management System (ELMS) (see IRM 6.410.1.2.2)."
LCMS allows online content developers from across the IRS to develop learning materials for all ELMS users.
"Being a shared system, it facilitates collaboration among developers within a business unit (business unit) as well as among business units by allowing content to be reused or repurposed to meet various training needs."
"IRS developers use the Production instance to create content, while select contractors use the External instance for the same purpose."
(2) Access to either instance of LCMS is restricted and requires approval by the system administrator in the LEADS Learning Technology Office of the Human Capital Office.
Access is granted only after completion of the required training in the use of LCMS.

(6) The fair use of a copyrighted work is not an infringement of copyright.
"Under this statutory exception, a determination as to whether a particular use is fair must be based on four factors:

The purpose and character of the use, which takes into consideration the commercial or noncommercial use of the copyrighted work;

The nature of the copyrighted work, which considers whether the copyrighted work is creative, factual, informational, or a combination thereof;

The amount and substantiality of the portion of the work to be copied, which takes into consideration whether the portion to be copied is the heart or focus of the work; and

The effect of the copyrighted work’s potential market caused by the copying, including whether an unauthorized use of a copyrighted work reduces the demand for the original such that the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work is impacted."
"(7) Examples of fair use could include:

Musical jingle to open a class

Downloading an internet graphic into a presentation

Using a short film clip to illustrate a point or generate a class discussion

Using a cartoon or comic strip to illustrate a point or generate a class discussion

(8) This exception to copyright law may be relied upon when a proposed use of a copyrighted work is appropriately determined to be fair given the specific facts."
(9) It is important to ensure that the fair use analysis produces a clear answer as to whether the exception would apply in a particular situation.
If it does not produce a clear answer permission must be obtained to use the copyrighted work.
Note: Proper care and judgment must always be used when applying the fair use act.
Failure to do so may result in a copyright infringement suit against the agency.

"6.410.1.4.4.6.1 (04-23-2019)
Responsibility for Training Instructors
(1) Leadership and Cross-Functional (LCF) is responsible for developing and providing Servicewide instructor training materials."
LCF is responsible for training instructors within business units to effectively teach servicewide instructor training courses and for conducting research into new instructional methods and media for supporting instructors.
"(2) The business unit is responsible for scheduling and training all Classroom Instructors, Virtual Classroom Instructors, and On-the-Job Instructors shortly after their selection."
(3) All prospective Classroom Instructors must successfully complete the Classroom Instructor Training (ELMS 15382) before instructing.
Newly appointed OJT/OJI Instructors should complete an OJT/OJI Instructor Workshop.
Initial instructional assignments should be scheduled no later than twelve months from completion of the CIT.
"(4) Additional instructor development opportunities:

Classroom instructors and their managers will identify appropriate additional training needs and opportunities."
CDS should arrange for placement of classroom instructors into needed training courses.
"Creation and implementation of a Career Learning Plan (CLP) is encouraged, with a focus on attending courses that will enhance instructional skills."
"This may include training in facilitation skills and the effective use of new technological tools (for example: distance learning, virtual environment (e.g."
"Saba Meeting), computer-assisted training, DVD, etc.)."
Training and development of Resident Lead Instructors (RLI) are the responsibilities of the business unit.
RLIs and their managers will create a CLP to meet additional identified needs.
The CLP may include such activities as: course design and development; facilitation skills; advanced instructional design; Instructor Trainer Workshop (ITW) for Classroom Instructor Training (CIT); and instruction in new training techniques.
(5) Lead instructors and their managers will identify appropriate additional training needs and opportunities.
(6) The business unit functional training coordinators will arrange for placement of lead instructors into needed training courses.
(7) Lead instructors are encouraged to develop a CLP that will encompass development in such areas as: conflict management; facilitation skills; instructor skills; and advanced instructional techniques.
"6.410.1.4.4.6.1.1 (04-23-2019)
Instructor Training Courses
(1) The role of the instructor in the IRS varies and includes several distinct delivery systems to present instruction, including: classroom, VEC webcast, CBT, OJT/OJI, virtual classroom, and blended training."
Each of these modes of instruction requires participation by the instructor who manages the overall learning activity.
"Consequently, instructors must know the advantages and limitations of each delivery system and the corresponding management role."
"(2) Instructor training courses offered by the Service are designed to equip IRS personnel assigned to instructor duties with the knowledge, skill, and abilities required to present interesting, cost beneficial, and effective instruction."
(3) Individuals selected to be classroom instructors must successfully complete Classroom Instructor Training (CIT) (ELMS 15382).
"CIT topics include training objectives, lesson planning, principles of adult learning, methods of instruction, use of instructional aids, managing the learning environment, and classroom management."
CIT participants are given opportunities to practice these skills during multiple teaching exercises.
(4) A Classroom Instructor Recommendation Sheet is completed for each student at the completion of the CIT.
The original Recommendation Sheet is given to the student during the class close-out.
"One copy is sent through the appropriate business unit to the student's manager, and one copy will be retained in the instructor cadre file."
Failure to successfully complete the CIT is discussed with the student and the student's immediate manager.
"(5) The requirement for completion of CIT may be waived at the discretion of a business unit functional training coordinator, if any of the following conditions apply:

The instructor has similar documented instructional experience (e.g."
"college, school systems, instructing in private sector business, other government agencies, and/or military services)."
The instructor can demonstrate effective instructional skills and technical expertise equivalent to those gained by successful completion of the CIT.
Prospective instructors can prepare and teach a simulated job-related technical lesson to a designated CDS evaluator and Subject Matter Expert (SME) to demonstrate effective instructional skills.
"If the instructor will NOT be assigned to teach in the physical, face-to-face classroom environment, and will be instructing in online virtual classes, the instructor should instead take Instructor Basics for Virtual Instructors (IBVI), (ELMS 57096), followed by Virtual Classroom Instructor Training (ELMS 13733)."
"(6) Final certification as a member of the instructor cadre is not given until a student instructor has satisfactorily completed his or her initial instructor assignment(s) - and has received an evaluative rating of M / Meets in all six competencies on Form 12088, Evaluation of Instructor Competencies."
The initial instructor assignment(s) should be of sufficient length and complexity to clearly indicate instructional ability.
"Sufficient length and complexity can depend on a number of factors, including the subject matter, the length and complexity of the lessons or course, and the instructional methodologies used by the instructor."
"Before an instructor is certified as a member of the instructor cadre, the initial instructor assignments should total at least 10 hours of instructional time."
"This would allow the new instructor to receive coaching and feedback on his or her teaching performance (in effect, similar to an OJT/OJI experience)."
"Ideally, the initial instructor assignment(s) should be to teach subject matter with which the new instructor is already familiar."
"This would allow the new instructor to concentrate on perfecting his or her instructor skills and techniques, rather than requiring extensive technical research during prep."
"(For example, a new Revenue Officer instructor could teach a Revenue Officer Recruit training class.)"
"If possible, the new instructor should not be required to perform the functions of a Lead Instructor during his or her initial instructor assignment(s)."
"This would allow the new instructor to concentrate on perfecting his or her instructor skills and techniques, without the burden of additional administrative class/course duties."
(7) Classroom Instructor Training Refresher (CITR) (ELMS 15383) should be attended by any instructor who has not taught within the previous 18 to 24 months and has not been given an upcoming teaching assignment.
CDS or the business unit may also require attendance at CITR for any new instructor candidate who has not successfully completed his or her first instructional assignment within twelve months of successfully completing CIT.
"(8) The requirement for attendance at CITR may be waived at the discretion of the business unit functional training coordinator, depending on the instructor’s background and experience."
"Possible alternate methods include:

Demonstration of effective instructional skills and technical expertise equivalent to those gained by successful completion of CIT (e.g."
"prepare and teach a simulated job-related technical lesson to a qualified business unit official), and

A qualified business unit official has personal knowledge of the instructor’s current teaching competencies based on numerous successful teaching assignments and/or outside instructional experience."
(9) Expert instructors selected to teach CIT must complete the Instructor Training Workshop (ITW) for CIT - (ELMS 15383).
(10) Classroom instructors should attend any applicable train-the-trainer classes for specific courses they are assigned to teach.
"(11) Individuals selected to teach online virtual classes must successfully complete the following courses, as applicable:

Course 15382, Classroom Instructor Training (CIT) (or equivalent) if the instructor will be assigned to teach in both the physical, face-to-face classroom environment and the virtual classroom environment;

Course 57096 (IBVI), if the instructor will ONLY be assigned to teach in the virtual classroom environment (and has not previously completed Course 15382, CIT); followed by Virtual Classroom Instructor Training (VCIT) (ELMS 13733)

Project Sponsored Training Request (PSTR) Saba Meeting Event Leader training (ELMS 61984 or equivalent);

VCIT or equivalent."
"If the instructor will be assigned to teach in the virtual classroom environment and has already completed Course 15382(CIT), and

Course 61984, Saba Event training is a prerequisite for both IBVI and VCIT."
"Note: Individuals should also have:

Basic/Intermediate PowerPoint skills

Event Manager ""Permissions"" profiled in Saba Meeting

(12) The requirement for completion of Instructor Basics for Virtual Instructors (IBVI), Course 57096, and Virtual Classroom Instructor Training (VCIT), Course 13733, may be waived at the discretion of a business unit coordinator, if both of the following criteria are met:

The instructor has similar virtual instructional experience (e.g."
"college, school systems, instructing in private sector business, other government agencies, or military services) which is documented, and

The instructor can demonstrate effective Virtual Instructor skills and technical expertise equivalent to those gained by successful completion of VCIT."
"Prospective instructors can prepare and teach a simulated job-related technical lesson via the virtual environment, such as Saba Meeting, to a designated CDS evaluator and subject matter expert to demonstrate effective Virtual Instructor skills."

"(3) For guidance on how to use Form 12088 when evaluating classroom, Interactive Video Training, or virtual instructors, refer to the following in Exhibit 6.410.1-1, Job Aids for Evaluating Instructors:

General Guidelines When Performing Instructor Evaluations

Elements & Standards Guidance for Evaluating Classroom Instructors

Elements & Standards Guidance for Evaluating VEC Webcast Instructors

Elements & Standards Guidance for Evaluating Virtual Instructors

(4) Each new instructor should begin his or her initial teaching assignment(s) within twelve months after completion of Classroom Instructor Training or Virtual Classroom Instructor Training, as applicable, and be evaluated during his/her initial teaching assignment(s)."
Other instructors should be evaluated as requested by the business unit management or when deemed appropriate and feasible to ensure the quality of training in the IRS.
business unit Training Coordinators and Centralized Delivery Services training managers are responsible for arranging and coordinating the evaluation of instructors.
"(5) Evaluations should be based on actual observations of the instructor’s performance while teaching and should be made by a qualified evaluator (i.e., Human Resources Specialist, Education Services Consultant, Lead Instructor, Resident Lead Instructor and a Subject Matter Expert (SME) who has successfully completed (ELMS 15378), Evaluating Instructors)."
The evaluator and the SME will collaboratively take into account the technical and procedural accuracy of the instruction in addition to the application of sound instructional methods and practice.
"(6) Evaluators should use Form 12088, Evaluation of Instructor Competencies (see Exhibit 6.410.1-1) as the guide when evaluating an instructor’s performance."
"Although all factors on the form should be considered, certain factors may be more applicable than others in some situations."
"The main emphasis, however, in all evaluations should be on student achievement of instructional objectives."
The ultimate goal of effective instruction is enhanced job performance.
(7) The observation period to determine the effectiveness of an instructor’s performance should be of sufficient duration and/or made frequently enough to allow an accurate and complete evaluation of that person’s instructor skills and technical knowledge.
"The length of a given observation period and/or the number of observations required to make an effective evaluation can depend upon a number of factors, including the subject matter being taught, the length and complexity of the lesson or of the entire course, the experience of the instructor being evaluated, and the instructional methodologies being used by the instructor."
"(In the absence of other mitigating factors, a 1-hour observation period is likely to provide the best opportunity for observing the full range of an instructor’s skills.)"
Some instructors may need to be evaluated more often than others.
(8) Instructor evaluations may also take into account a variety of information sources.
"Examples include:

Test results on topics taught by the instructor;

Instructor specific comments from mid-course reviews and/or Level 1 evaluation forms;

Discussions with the Lead Instructor; and

Examination of administrative paperwork prepared by the instructor such as annotations to student evaluation guides, written records of student counseling sessions, etc."
"(9) The evaluator should discuss the evaluation with the instructor (either in person, by phone or via Skype, as needed) and provide the instructor with a copy of the Form 12088."
Copies of the completed form should be processed in accordance with procedures established by the instructor’s business unit.
A copy is given to the instructor’s manager and a copy is retained by Centralized Delivery Services (CDS).
"(10) If an instructor disagrees with an evaluation, he or she will have an opportunity to discuss the evaluation with the appropriate CDS Site manager or technical skills evaluator before the final evaluation is shared with the instructor’s manager of record."
"(11) If any Competency Area of an instructor’s evaluation is rated ""Needs Improvement (NI)"", the instructor should receive appropriate counseling, including suggestions for improving performance."
"The instructor’s manager, in conjunction with the business unit Functional Training Coordinator's staff, should ensure that the instructor receives appropriate developmental assignments and/or training."
"If in any subsequent instructional assignment that Competency Area is again rated ""Needs Improvement (NI)"", the business unit should consider removing the instructor from the instructor cadre."
"6.410.1.4.5.1 (10-30-2016)
Evaluation Procedures for On-the-Job Training
(1) An On-The-Job-Training (OJT/OJI) Instructor should be evaluated as outlined in the appropriate business unit OJT/OJI Guide."
The emphasis of the evaluation should be on trainee achievement of the instructional objectives.
The ultimate goal of any effective instruction is enhanced student performance.
(2) Managers evaluate part-time OJT/OJI Instructors based on the entire range of OJT/OJI activities.
"6.410.1.4.5.2 (10-30-2016)

"6.410.1.4.8 (10-30-2016)
Testing
(1) The criterion-referenced approach to testing is to be used throughout the training system."
This is also known as mastery testing.
This approach to testing ensures that training builds competencies.
A criterion test focuses on the application of knowledge and skills required to perform job-related tasks.
Enabling Learning Objectives (ELOs) build toward Terminal Learning Objectives (TLOs).
TLOs relate to job tasks.
"Therefore, tests must relate to job tasks and must be performance-oriented."
All tests must also be face and content valid.
"6.410.1.4.8.1 (10-30-2016)
Development of Test Items
(1) Testing must be administered in classes conducted for courses that require Level 2 Evaluation."
"At a minimum, there must be a final or ""mastery"" test of the terminal objectives."
Pre-testing and post-testing may also be conducted.
(2) Test development is an integral part of the course design and development process.
Course developers or program managers charged with the responsibility for developing/revising courses are also responsible for developing/revising test items and tests that measure the course objectives.
"6.410.1.4.8.2 (10-30-2016)
Distribution of Tests
(1) Tests, with instructions and scoring keys, will be provided to the respective CDS staffs handling course delivery prior to instructor preparation if this information is not already provided in the Instructor Guide."
The CDS staff will ensure that test materials are timely and securely delivered to the Lead Instructor at the training site.
The Lead Instructor for the class is responsible for disposition of the tests and for providing test results to the course development project manager as indicated in the instructor guide or as directed by their business unit.
"(2) In order to expedite mailing and to ensure the security of tests, scoring keys, and test results data, registered mail or express mail will be used."
The test and the answers to the test should be mailed separately.
"6.410.1.4.8.3 (10-30-2016)
Security Guidelines for Tests and Test Materials
(1) Tests, scoring keys, and test results data are confidential and must be safe-guarded accordingly."
The materials must be handled with utmost care at all times to ensure that they are seen only by authorized persons.
Employees having access to test materials are responsible for ensuring their security.
"(2) All offices that have custody of test materials should, at a minimum, store this material in metal file cabinets without outside labeling as to the exact contents."
The cabinets will be locked and only persons having a valid need should be given the combination of the lock or keys to the cabinet(s).
"(3) Instructors must receive the test(s) at the beginning of their preparation time and ensure security of the tests and scoring keys through administration, scoring, test de-briefing, and data compilation."
"Afterwards, instructors must return all tests (completed and otherwise) and scoring keys to CDS staff for control and security."
"6.410.1.4.8.4 (10-30-2016)
Test Results Data
(1) Personnel responsible for test administration will maintain test results data in a secure system of records, For Official Use Only, access to which is on a need to know basis."
"Note: When a course is completed through the SF-182 process, the grade entered into ELMS when a learning event is recorded will display on the Learning History reports."
"6.410.1.4.9 (10-30-2016)
Trainee Performance Information
(1) Classroom performance data includes information concerning trainee test results, classroom attendance, participation, and other indicators of trainee accomplishments, motivation, interest, attitude, or learning ability."
"(2) At an appropriate checkpoint during classroom training, designated business unit personnel, with the assistance of the instructor(s), will determine whether any trainee is at risk of failure or whether performance is otherwise substandard."
The trainee first should be counseled.
"(3) If trainee performance does not improve as a result of counseling, the instructor will notify the designated management official of the business unit."
"(4) Decisions to remove a trainee from a training course may not, however, be based solely on data from invalidated tests."
"(5) Each trainee’s performance in a course will be summarized to include, at a minimum, a list of the training objectives met and the training objectives not met."
The instructor will provide this report to the trainee’s manager.
(6) The Enterprise Learning Management Systems (ELMS) Training History will be completed in accordance with ELMS procedures.
"(7) If a trainee is required to complete a course which is a prerequisite to another course, he or she should meet the minimum standard for the prerequisite course before being admitted to the advanced or other course."
"In those exceptional situations in which a functional manager elects to re-nominate a trainee to complete the same course again, or nominate a trainee who has not completed the prerequisites for a course, the reasons for the nomination should be stated in a memorandum attached to the certification."
"6.410.1.4.10 (10-30-2016)
Attendance Requirements at Training Events, Meetings or Conferences
(1) Meetings, conferences, and other events often provide an important opportunity for improving the effective management of agency programs or delivery of training."
"The IRS may pay an employee’s expenses for attending a meeting, conference, or other event as a training expense when:

The purpose of the conference, meeting or event is educational/ instructional."
The content is germane to improving individual and/or organizational performance.
"More than half of the time scheduled for the conference, meeting or event consists of planned, organized exchanges of information between presenters and audience."
The employee will derive developmental benefits through attending.
(2) Records of instruction and attendance for each day of the course or each session within a course shall be maintained in the IRS system of records.
"Form 10268 (Training Registration Record) and Form 13733 (Training Attendance Log) or other equivalent forms, may be used to facilitate recordation."
See section 6.410.1.3.11(12) IRM 6.410.1.3.11.3 (12) regarding documentation requirements for off-site events.
(3) See Record Keeping Requirements in section 6.410.1.3.11.3 (12).
"(4) Treasury Directive 12-70 procedures should be followed to minimize event-related costs and ensure expenditures are properly reviewed, justifiable and necessary to fulfill the vision and mission of the IRS."
(5) Employees and managers who are scheduled and approved to attend training events are expected to attend the entire event.
"A training event includes all training delivery platforms such as in-person classroom, virtual classroom (e.g."
"Saba Meeting, Live Meeting, webinars) and online learning."
Emergencies do arise that may prevent a student from attending all of the training.
"An emergency is any situation requiring the employee’s immediate attention, which cannot be predicted by the employee or the supervisor prior to the training."
"If an emergency arises, a student must obtain an authorized absence from the instructor and manager."
"(6) For all authorized absences not exceeding 10 percent of the training event, the student is expected to make up all assignments, activities and tests per an agreement with the instructor and manager."
"Any student missing in excess of 10 percent of the training event, will not receive credit in ELMS for the course."
"In this case, the entire course must be retaken."
"Exceptions are noted below:

For general IRS CPE events that are informational and do not require Level 2 proficiency, students with an authorized absence should not miss more than 30 percent of the training in order to receive ELMS credit."
"However, the sponsoring business unit may determine a higher attendance requirement depending on the nature of the subject matter."

"(2) This subsection is organized into the following categories:

Readiness Programs

Leadership Curriculum

Leadership Training Policies and Procedures

Leadership Training Measures and Reports

Leadership Resources

6.410.1.5.1 (04-23-2019)
Readiness Programs
(1) The Leadership Readiness Programs are a critical part of the IRS Succession Planning Strategy."
Their purpose is to identify and train qualified individuals selected by their business unit who aspire to the next level of leadership.
Classes are taught by vendors and experienced IRS executives and managers who provide participants with developmental challenges and opportunities that increase their skills and knowledge to prepare them for the next step in their careers.
"(2) The IRS has the following readiness programs for each level of leadership:

Frontline Leader Readiness Program (FLRP) - is designed to identify and develop high-potential, motivated employees for front line manager positions throughout the service."
The nine month program is the beginning of a process aimed at development of IRS leaders.
The program starts a transformational process to prepare participants for leadership before they are permanently selected as front line managers.
This is accomplished through experiential opportunities in and out of the classroom.
1) Announcement and Selection- Participants are competitively selected by the business unit for the program.
The target audience is employees who aspire to apply for a front line manager position upon completion of the program.
This highly successful program identifies and accelerates the development of our front line management base.
Applicants for FLRP must meet eligibility requirements for a front line management position.
"2) Curriculum and Course Content- The program develops the participants with an extensive exploration of leadership competencies through pre and post classroom, classroom and virtual sessions, web-based research tools and shadow and acting assignments."
A major component of the program is the use of the DISC assessment.
The value of self-awareness in communications assists participants in both work and personal situations.
Participants are placed into table teams and the networking extends far into their careers.
3) Coaching - Participants are assigned a coach.
Additionally their manager of record and their table team instructor serve as coaches.
4) Developmental Assignments - FLRP includes two developmental activities after completion of the week 1 classroom session: a one week shadow assignment and a minimum 60 day consecutive acting manager assignment.
5) Program Completion Criteria- FLRP Program certification is completed by the participant’s table team instructor and their manager of record certifying that all requirements of the program have been met.
6) Participant Progress and Program Completion- A FLRP Tracking Spreadsheet is maintained by the instructor for each participant in the table team.
A tracking database is also available to all IRS business units for tracking FLRP participants and graduates.

"The six administrative components of the LLRC are:
Announcement and Selection
business units announce and fill for the DMRP/SMRP as needed for succession planning in their business unit."
Business units will form their own interview panels and interview candidates applying for their DMRP/SMRP.
"Cross-business unit panels are optional

Final selections are made by the business units."
"LSR ratings (leadership competencies and behaviors) are used for 50% of ranking, and business unit specific technical competencies are ranked by the business units and count for 50% of the ranking."
(Criteria above is already established in MSP 2.0 process.)
"Curriculum and Course Content
Department Manager and Senior Manager Readiness Program participants will attend the Leading Leaders Readiness Course (LLRC) and will attend the two week Senior Manager Course when selected for a permanent department or senior manager position."
"Coaching and Mentoring

SMRP participants will receive training and practice as part of the Leading Leaders Readiness Course on how to effectively coach and mentor others."
"Developmental Assignments (functional and cross-functional)
business unit Executive Champions retain responsibility for developmental assignments for their DMRP/SMRP participants."
Participants must have executive approval before accepting a developmental assignment.
Business units are encouraged to identify developmental assignments and opportunities that do not require immediate business-specific technical expertise.
These assignments will be made available to program participants from other business units to facilitate the possibility of placing participants into positions for which they lack the technical background.
Assignments may be function-specific to meet the business division’s needs.
A Servicewide opportunity website is available for business units to post DMRP/SMRP developmental opportunities.
Use of the website is not required but encouraged.
The website is similar to the Executive Readiness (XR) Opportunities website.
Business Units are encouraged to leverage the Geographic Leadership Communities (GLCs) to assist in identifying local business unit or cross-business unit developmental opportunities for DMRP/SMRP participants.
The development assignment is at least 120 days and may be extended.
"Program Completion Criteria
Required Program elements:

Completion of the six virtual Saba Meeting sessions and one-week classroom session

Note: A tracking database is available to all IRS business units for tracking DMRP/SMRP participants and graduates."
"The database will emulate the XR database design, adapting like components as they fit for the DMRP/SMRP program."
A Web Career Learning Plan (WebCLP) is required - LSR assessment and other sources of feedback on competencies and behaviors will significantly inform WebCLP activities.
Complete all WebCLP activities.
Participants should complete program requirements within a year of their entry into the program.
"At the option of the participant’s business unit, program completion can be extended to two years."
"Participant Progress and Program Completion

A tracking database is available to all IRS business units for tracking DMRP/SMRP participants and graduates."

(3) Additional information on each of these programs is available at: http://hco.web.irs.gov/devtrain/LEAD/leaddev.html.
"6.410.1.5.2.2 (04-23-2019)
Senior Manager Curriculum
(1) Following are the courses in the Senior Manager Curriculum:

The Senior Manager Course (SMC) - provides mid-level managers (new department and senior managers) with an intensive focus on the senior leadership competencies that comprise the significant skills needed to effectively perform at the senior level."
It is a highly experiential program that explores the impact of individual behavior on team success and demonstrates the critical role effective leadership skills play in implementing strategic plans.
"Leading Strategic Corporate Change and Transition- This is a highly interactive, experientially based course."
Case studies are used throughout the course which participants must dissect and apply to their operational experiences.
A simulation is also included and threads through the entire course.
Participants are teamed up to experience the simulation in sub-groups and then debrief their learning across the teams in the class.
Tools and templates are provided to participants for their use back on the job.
Participants have opportunities to practice using the tools in their real-life simulated transitions that they will be required to implement and manage during the course.
Course instruction is provided by an external non-IRS vendor.
"6.410.1.5.2.3 (04-23-2019)
Executive Curriculum
(1) The Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program (SESCDP) is the principal means through which the IRS seeks to identify and hire a career executive corps."
"The CDP is a minimum of one year and maximum of two years in length, and consists of formal training (Executive Development-XD-Program) and developmental assignments."
Its purpose is to identify outstanding persons with demonstrated leadership competencies and to prepare them for senior executive positions.
"(2) Entry into the Senior Executive Service (SES) is based on performance, OPM certification, and the availability of positions."
Selections are guided by an assessment of an applicant’s demonstrated leadership experience.
"Graduates of the SES CDP are eligible for OPM’s Qualification Review Board certification, which is required in order to become a member of the Service’s corps of executives."
(3) Additional information is available at: http://hco.web.irs.gov/about/divisionspro/es/careeropt/index.html.
"6.410.1.5.3 (10-30-2016)
Leadership Training Policies and Procedures
(1) The following policies and procedures are addressed:

Scheduling Leadership Classes and Instructors

Training Temporary and Seasonal Managers

Canceling Leadership Classes

Instructor and Participant Responsibilities

Training Leadership Instructors

Evaluating Leadership Instructors

6.410.1.5.3.1 (10-30-2016)
Scheduling Leadership Classes and Instructors
(1) Needs assessment process - In April or May of each year, Leadership, Education and Delivery Services initiates a collaborative process with business unit customers to determine the number and type of each leadership program to be scheduled for that upcoming fiscal year."
"(2) Instructor solicitation process - After the needs assessment process is complete, Centralized Delivery Services solicits for instructors for all front line manager classes in a coordinated way and schedules them into classes."
"6.410.1.5.3.2 (10-30-2016)
Training Temporary and Seasonal Managers
(1) The Wage and Investment (W&I) Leadership Governance Board approved a proposal to establish a separate curriculum for front line seasonal and cadre managers."
After discussions with Human Capital Office (HCO) Leadership and Cross Functional Training (LCF) and Centralized Delivery Services (CDS) this curriculum was developed and approved by all parties.
It is to be used only for W&I seasonal/cadre managers who support filing season (primarily located in Accounts Management and Submission Processing).
The local organizations will schedule the classes to fit their schedules.
"They are responsible for loading the seasonal curriculum in the manager’s ELMS Learning Plan, securing instructors and classrooms, with assistance from CDS when needed."
(2) All other new W&I permanent managers will be trained according to HCO guidelines and time frames for attending the training.
(3) W&I will conduct separate Fundamental Management Skills and Front Line Managers Course programs for seasonal/cadre managers.
Participants will be scheduled.
Certified LCF instructors will be used.
Approved instruction will be followed except as noted in the W&I Seasonal and Cadre Front Line Manager Training Outline.
LCF will establish separate ELMS numbers for these classes so they can be differentiated from the cross-functional programs attended by permanent managers.
(4) The curriculum for W&I front line seasonal and cadre managers is outlined at: http://hco.web.irs.gov/pdf/SeasCadreMgTrain%20Agremt.pdf.
"6.410.1.5.3.3 (04-23-2019)
Cancelling Leadership Classes
(1) As with other work-related emergencies, communication is critical in a) deciding to cancel a class and b) ensuring that all affected know of the decision to cancel."
No policy can cover all situations.
"When weather or other conditions may affect a leadership class, it is important that the lines of communication remain open and that instructors, participants, and their managers have the most current information about the class."
Classes already in session - Instructors will contact the local CDS support staff who will then contact the CDS leadership point of contact for the program who would then contact the LCF program manager.
The program manager will facilitate making the decision if the class will continue or not.
"Final determination to close the class will be made by the LCF Director, after consultation with the program manager."
Classes not yet started - The decision to cancel classes will be made as far in advance as possible.
"That decision will be made by the LCF Associate Director, in consultation with the program manager."
"After the decision to cancel is made, the LCF program manager will work in conjunction with the CDS leadership point of contact to send messages to instructors, participants and their managers."
CDS will also send an ELMS notification canceling the class.
"When possible, the program manager will attempt personal contact with the instructors and participants."
"6.410.1.5.3.4 (10-30-2016)
Instructor and Participant Responsibilities
(1) The timely training of managers at both the front line and senior levels is vital to the development of IRS leadership and to the succession planning process."
The training process is significantly compromised when participants and instructors fail to attend the training as scheduled or fail to follow the directions in the reporting instructions.
"Compromises in the training process minimize effectiveness for both the organization as a whole, as well as the participants."
(2) Any participant or instructor withdrawing from a class within 30 days of the class start date must obtain written approval from his/her line executive and concurrence from the business unit executive responsible for overall leadership development programs.
"In the case of classes which meet during separate weeks (e.g., Senior Manager Course, Frontline Leader Readiness Program), similar executive concurrence is required for anyone to miss either scheduled week."
"The business unit, in collaboration with CDS, is responsible for finding a qualified replacement for anyone who withdraws."
The Request Form for Participant/Instructor to Withdraw from a Leadership Training Class is a recommended form to use within an organization to request approval for participant/instructor withdrawal from a leadership class.
Access the form at: http://hco.web.irs.gov/pdf/Withdrawal_Request_Form.pdf.
Completed withdrawal forms will be retained by the instructor's or participant's business unit Learning and Education Function and a copy will be sent to the CDS point of contact for that leadership course.
(3) Late arrival or early departure - leadership programs are most effective when the classroom is filled for the entire program with participants from a cross-section of functions.
Classes are structured so the time is filled with lessons integral to the student's development.
Late arrival or early departure undermines the participant’s learning experience and is disruptive to the class in general.
Prior business unit approval is required and all program requirements for successful course completion must be met.
"(4) Once instructors and participants are confirmed for a class, they receive reporting instructions containing travel codes, hotel and transportation information along with other instructions to help them prepare for the class."
"It is important that they follow the directions in the reporting instructions especially those concerning hotel accommodations and pre-class work, otherwise this could impact pre-arranged benefits by the hotel for all participants and instructors."
Instructors and participants must make hotel reservations by the date indicated in the reporting instructions.
Instructors and participants must provide the name given for the block of rooms to the hotel at the time reservations are made.
Participants must complete any pre-class assignments.
Failure to do so jeopardizes the learning outcomes of the class and affects the other class participants.
"6.410.1.5.3.5 (10-30-2016)
Training Leadership Instructors
(1) Leadership and Cross-Functional Training (LCF) is responsible for training all IRS leadership instructors."
"(2) Fundamental Management Skills, Treasury Supervision 101: Leadership is a Choice, Leading Teams, and Frontline Leader Readiness Program rely on an internal leadership instructor cadre subdivided by program."
An instructor can be a member of more than one cadre.
(3) Those interested in becoming a leadership instructor apply in response to a solicitation from the Human Capital Office.
Selections (nominations) are made by the applicant's operating division following a review and evaluation of the submission (or application).
(4) Membership on the cadre is contingent on meeting certain criteria.
"Cadre members must:

Have completed Classroom Instructor Training or have equivalent experience;

Be a current manager (at any level) or be a non-bargaining unit employee with significant past management or organization development experience;

Have successfully completed a Leadership Instructor Training session; and

Be certified to instruct a program following a probationary period."
"(5) If a non-bargaining unit instructor converts to a bargaining unit position, he/she must be placed in “inactive” status until such time that he/she reverts to non-bargaining unit status."
(6) IRM 6.410.1.3.4.8 provides general training requirements for all IRS instructors.
"6.410.1.5.3.6 (04-23-2019)
Evaluating Leadership Instructors
(1) Individual instructors are evaluated in several ways:

Class participants offer feedback to instructors by way of the Level 1 class evaluation form completed at the end of each class."
Narrative comments can be made about each instructor and a numerical rating (1 to 5) can be made for the instructor team.
New instructors are evaluated on platform skills formally by Centralized Delivery Services (CDS) using Form 12088.
"A rating of Exceeds, Meets, or Needs Improvement is assigned."
The individual completing this type of evaluation is trained in Evaluating Instructors (ELMS 15378).
New instructors are also evaluated on technical skills by lead instructors using the Leadership Technical Instructor Evaluation Form approved for front line leadership courses.
This completed form will be submitted to CDS and attached to Form 12088.
Experienced instructors are evaluated by lead instructors using the Leadership Technical Instructor Evaluation Form approved for front line leadership courses.
"(2) Leadership Lead Instructor Responsibilities:

Lead instructors are encouraged to attend Course 15378 (Evaluating Instructors) to enable them to recognize effective instructor behavior and to provide effective feedback."
"Provide written and oral feedback, delivered in behavioral language using specific examples, to individual instructor team members on his or her performance."
This includes the prep week and classroom instruction.
The lead instructor will also provide the written feedback document to the Leadership and Cross Functional (LCF) program manager for the specific course taught.
Use the approved Leadership Technical Instructor Evaluation and Feedback Form (in fillable pdf format) at: http://hco.web.irs.gov/pdf/Leadership%20Technical%20Inst%20Eval%20Form.pdf.
Share the evaluative feedback with the instructor.
The lead instructor will forward the completed evaluation form to the LCF program manager for that leadership program.
The program manager will forward the information to the instructor’s leadership training coordinator and will create and maintain a file on each instructor.
Instructors who do not receive full endorsement from the lead instructor will be flagged for additional attention during the next class they teach.
Lack of improvement during that second class could result in removal from the instructor cadre.
"6.410.1.5.4 (10-30-2016)
Measures and Reports
(1) The following measures and reports are addressed:

Timeliness of Training

Slot Utilization

Program Reports

6.410.1.5.4.1 (10-30-2016)
Timeliness of Training
(1) One of the Human Capital Office (HCO) Business Plan measures is to track the timely completion of new manager training at the front line, department and senior manager levels."
The Learning and Development Executive Council (LDEC) established Attendance Requirements and Guidelines for attending IRS leadership critical courses.
"When new managers are selected at the front line, department and senior levels, they are assigned a leadership training curriculum that must be completed within twelve months to be considered trained timely."
"The timeliness of training measure is an important one: It is reported the data to the Commissioner and to the IRS Oversight Board, among others."
"Following are the courses that are measured and tracked:

Treasury Supervision 101: Leadership Is A Choice (TS101)

Senior Manager Course (SMC)

(2) Additional information regarding attendance requirements and guidelines for attending IRS leadership critical courses is available at: http://hco.web.irs.gov/devtrain/LEAD/requireLeadCurr.html."
(3) The tracking of timely completed new manager training and the identification of managers who have not completed required training timely or not at all is accomplished by Leadership and Cross Functional Training (LCF) maintaining a Timeliness of Training report.
The report is generated by combining new manager promotion names and selection dates received from the Agency-Wide Shared Services (AWSS) Reporting Center bi-weekly report and training history information in ELMS.
All report information is validated by the business units and the report is updated with any corrections on an annual basis.
"6.410.1.5.4.2 (10-30-2016)
Slot Utilization
(1) A slot utilization report is used to track participation rate for all leadership training to ensure leadership classes are filled to capacity for effective learning and optimum cost savings."
(2) Centralized Delivery Services (CDS) is responsible for pulling information from the Enterprise Learning Management System (ELMS) to generate the Slot Utilization Report.
The report is generated quarterly and shared with LCF program managers.
"(3) The formula for calculating the utilization rate is shown below:

Example: Each Leading Teams class can have a maximum of 24 participants."
During the quarter reviewed there were six classes with a total of 142 participants.
"To calculate the slot utilization:
Multiply 24 (maximum number of slots per class) by 6 (number of classes completed during quarter) = 144

Divide 144 by 142 (number of participants in completed classes) = 0.9861 = 99% (slot utilization rate)

6.410.1.5.4.3 (04-23-2019)
Program Reports
(1) LCF program managers prepare briefing reports focusing on:

Significant accomplishments and opportunities for improvement;

Changes in programs that have been implemented;

Identifying future improvements; and

"6.410.9.2 (02-21-2025)
Training Evaluation Overview
Evaluation is the phase of the TDQAS in which data is systematically collected, analyzed, and interpreted to determine the effectiveness of training."
"The IRS uses a four-level approach to training evaluation, based on one of the leading industry standards in the ﬁeld of training."
"This systematic approach, known as the Kirkpatrick Model, with New World Kirkpatrick Model Enhancements, ensures that the IRS gathers complete data that measures the effectiveness of training, while enabling course owners to identify course improvement opportunities."
Using the Kirkpatrick Model enables the IRS to effectively demonstrate the strategic value that training programs add to business results and the organization’s mission.
"The policies and procedures in this IRM apply to training owned, developed, or delivered by the IRS (i.e., LMS items with a CURR-xxx- domain)."
Programs that support or utilize vendor-owned or out-service training must establish appropriate procedures for evaluating these types of training.
"Note: If a training event includes multiple courses, apply the policies and procedures contained in this IRM individually to each course within the training event."
"6.410.9.2.1 (02-21-2025)
Level 1 Training Evaluation: Reaction
Level 1 training evaluation is the degree to which participants ﬁnd training favorable, engaging and relevant to their jobs."
Its purpose is to assess the immediate reaction of learners to the training.
"New World Kirkpatrick Model Level 1 dimensions include:
Customer Satisfaction - participants’ satisfaction with the training."
Engagement - the degree to which participants are actively involved in contributing to the learning experience.
Relevance - the degree to which participants believe they will have the opportunity to use or apply what they learned in training on the job.
The Level 1 evaluation process enables business units to gather and interpret participants’ reactions to the training they received.
"6.410.9.2.2 (02-21-2025)
Level 2 Training Evaluation: Learning
Level 2 training evaluation is the degree to which participants acquire the intended knowledge, skills, attitude, conﬁdence and commitment based on their participation in training."
Level 2 training evaluation can be either knowledge-based or performance-based.
"Term	Description
New World Kirkpatrick Model Level 1 dimensions include:
Knowledge - ""I know it."""
"Skill - ""I can do it right now."""
"Attitude - ""I believe this will be worthwhile to do on the job."""
"Conﬁdence - ""I think I can do it on the job."""
"Commitment - ""I intend to do it on the job."""
The Level 2 training evaluation process	Enables business units to gather and interpret participants’ level of learning based on the training they received.
Level 2 training evaluation can be quantitative or qualitative in nature.
Quantitative tests or assessments are those that express results in numbers.
"Examples of quantitative Level 2 evaluations include, but are not limited to:
Traditional graded knowledge tests (multiple choice, fill in the blank, calculate the equation, complete the form, etc."
"),
Graded knowledge checks, and
Graded individual case studies (i.e., L&E develops and provides a rubric for scoring the assignment)."
Qualitative methods don’t yield numerical results or are not easily scored.
They are any means by which students receive input and guiding feedback on their relative performance to help them improve.
"Examples of qualitative Level 2 evaluations include, but are not limited to:
Group or team exercises,
Presentations,
Work reviews,
Pass or fail assessments,
Questionnaires,
Interviews, and
Simulations,
Observations,
Self-assessments,
Pre or post assessments,
Role plays,
Action learning."
Note: Developing a grading scheme can convert most qualitative methods to quantitative methods.
"6.410.9.2.3 (02-21-2025)
Level 3 Training Evaluation: Behavior
Level 3 training evaluation is the degree to which participants apply what they learned during training when they are back on the job."
"New World Kirkpatrick Model Level 3 training evaluation dimensions include:
Required Drivers: Processes and systems that reinforce, monitor, encourage and reward performance."
"Examples of required drivers include work review checklists, job aids, recognition, coaching, mentoring, etc."
"Critical Behaviors: The few, specific actions that will have the biggest impact on the desired results if performed consistently on the job."
"For the IRS, critical behaviors are the same as enabling learning objectives (ELOs) or terminal learning objectives (TLOs)."
On-the-Job Learning: A culture and expectation that individuals are responsible for maintaining the knowledge and skills to enhance their own performance.
The Level 3 training evaluation process enables business units to gather and interpret the level of impact the training had on participants behavior.
"6.410.9.2.4 (02-21-2025)
Level 4 Training Evaluation: Results
Level 4 training evaluation is the degree to which targeted outcomes occur as a result of training."
It assesses the impact of the improvements in the trainees’ performance on the mission of the organization.
Business units must be able to identify and provide data on measures that have organizational impact.
New World Kirkpatrick Model Level 4 training evaluation dimensions include leading indicators which are short-term observations and measurements suggesting that critical behaviors are on track to create a positive impact on desired results.
"Examples of leading indicators include balanced measure ratings, compliance ratings, customer response ratings, etc."
The Level 4 evaluation process enables business units to gather and interpret the results the training had on the organization.
"6.410.9.3 (02-21-2025)
Level 1 Training Evaluation Policies and Procedures
All training events require Level 1 training evaluations."
"Exception: Level 1 training evaluation policies and procedures may be applied to one-time events as resources allow; however, they are not mandatory for one-time events."
A one-time event is defined as an event only delivered to one group of participants.
"The event may take place in multiple sessions, but they must all be within a sixty-day time frame."
"L&E must notate ""One-time event"" in the item comments field in the LMS."
L&E must document the Level 1 evaluation requirements for each item in the LMS.

Performance Management Overview
Performance management is the systematic process by which the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) involves its employees, as individuals and members of a group, in improving organizational effectiveness to accomplish the Service's mission and goals."
"Performance management integrates the processes that the IRS uses to:
Communicate and clarify organizational goals to employees."
"Identify individual and, where applicable, team accountability for accomplishing organizational goals."
"Identify and address developmental needs for individuals and, where applicable, teams."
"Assess and improve individual, team, and organizational performance."
Use appropriate measures of performance as the basis for recognizing and rewarding accomplishments.
Use the results of performance appraisals as a basis for appropriate personnel actions.
"The IRS Performance Management program provides a framework for supervisors and employees to improve communications, coordinate planning activities, link individual and organizational performance, and ensure fair and consistent treatment of taxpayers."
"6.430.1.2 (06-14-2011)

"6.430.1.4 (01-01-2007)
Foundation of the Performance Management Program
The foundation of the IRS Performance Management program rests on four guiding principles that:
Strengthen the linkages between performance management and the Service’s mission, strategic business goals, business plans, and the IRS Balanced Measurement System."
"Support the Service’s culture and enhance results through a systematic, ongoing process."
"Change the perception of performance management as a time-consuming, stressful human resource activity to a process for helping achieve business objectives."
Ensure long-term success by balancing the achievement of results with demonstration of actions taken to achieve them.
"6.430.1.5 (01-01-2007)
Key Performance Management Activities
In effective organizations, managers and employees have been practicing good performance management naturally all their lives, executing each key component process well."
Goals are set and work is planned routinely.
Progress toward those goals is measured and employees get feedback.
"High standards are set, but care is also taken to develop the skills needed to reach them."
Formal and informal rewards are used to recognize the behavior and results that accomplish the mission.
"All four component processes working together and supporting each other achieve natural, effective performance management."
"The four steps of IRS performance management are:
Planning expectations
Monitoring progress
Evaluating performance
Recognizing performance

6.430.1.5.1 (01-01-2007)
Planning Expectations
Planning means setting performance expectations and goals for groups and individuals to channel their efforts toward achieving organizational objectives."
"Getting employees involved in the planning process will help them understand the goals of the organization, what needs to be done, why it needs to be done, and how well it should be done."
"In an effective organization, work is planned out in advance."
The regulatory requirements for planning employees' performance include establishing the critical elements and performance standards of their performance plans.
"Performance elements and standards should be measurable, understandable, verifiable, equitable, and achievable."
"Through critical elements, employees are held accountable as individuals for work assignments or responsibilities."
Employee performance plans should be flexible so that they can be adjusted for changing program objectives and work requirements.
"When used effectively, these plans can be beneficial working documents that are discussed often, and not merely paperwork that is filed in a drawer and seen only when ratings of record are required."
"6.430.1.5.2 (01-01-2007)
Monitoring Progress
Monitoring well means consistently measuring performance and providing ongoing feedback to employees and work groups on their progress toward reaching their goals."
"In an effective organization, assignments and projects are monitored continually."
Regulatory requirements for monitoring performance include conducting progress reviews with employees where their performance is compared against their elements and standards.
Ongoing monitoring provides the opportunity to check how well employees are meeting predetermined standards and to make changes to unrealistic or problematic standards.
"And by monitoring continually, unacceptable performance can be identified at any time during the appraisal period and assistance provided to address such performance rather than wait until the end of the period when summary rating levels are assigned."
"6.430.1.5.3 (01-01-2007)
Evaluating Performance
From time to time, organizations find it useful to summarize employee performance."
This can be helpful for looking at and comparing performance over time or among various employees.
Organizations need to know who their best performers are.
"Within the context of formal performance appraisal requirements, rating means evaluating employee or group performance against the critical elements and performance standards in an employee's performance plan and assigning a summary rating of record."
The rating of record is assigned according to procedures included in the Service’s appraisal program and is based on work performed during an entire appraisal period.
"The rating of record has a bearing on various other personnel actions, such as granting within-grade pay increases and determining additional retention service credit in a reduction in force."
"6.430.1.5.4 (01-01-2007)
Recognizing Performance
Rewarding means recognizing employees, individually and as members of groups, for their performance and acknowledging their contributions to the agency's mission."
"In an effective organization, rewards are used well."
Another critical component of recognizing performance is the supervisor's obligation to address employee performance that does not meet performance expectations.
Most performance problems can be resolved through effective communication and counseling between the supervisor and the employee.
Addressing the need for improvement as it is observed will often correct poor performance before a performance-based action is necessary.
Good performance is recognized without waiting for nominations for formal awards to be solicited.
"Recognition is an ongoing, natural part of day-to-day experience."
"A lot of the actions that reward good performance — like saying ""Thank you"" — do not require a specific regulatory authority."
"Award regulations provide a broad range of forms that more formal rewards can take, such as cash, time off, and many nonmonetary items."
"The regulations also cover a variety of contributions that can be rewarded, from suggestions to group accomplishments."
"6.430.1.6 (06-14-2011)

"Retention Standard– The performance standard that describes the level of performance necessary to be retained in a job (i.e., the standard written for performance one level above the ""Unacceptable"" or ""Not Met"" level)."
"In the IRS, the retention standard is the ""Minimally Successful"" or ""Minimally Satisfactory"" standard."
Retroactive Performance Appraisal – A retroactive performance appraisal is a performance appraisal prepared by the supervisor after the designated period of time required to prepare the performance appraisal has elapsed or after a subsequent rating of record has been issued.
Retroactive performance appraisals are barred by OPM regulations and IRS policy.
No IRS official may produce or change a performance appraisal more than 364 days past the ending date of the employee's appraisal period or past a period for which a subsequent rating of record has been issued.
Revalidated Performance Appraisal – A performance appraisal for a journey level or above employee in at least the second year of his or her position who receives a rating of record for the current performance appraisal period that is identical in every way to the rating of record received for the previous period.

The self-assessment outlines the actions taken by the employee in achieving the critical performance expectations or performance aspects specified by the CJEs.
Summary Levels – The designators assigned to the summarization of the appraisal of employee performance against individual performance elements.
"Actual performance is compared to the CJEs and performance aspects in the employee’s performance plan or the critical performance expectations for managers, management officials, and confidential management/program analysts."
All IRS performance plans contain five summary levels.
The summary level becomes the employee’s rating of record.
"Summary Rating – Part III of the Manager, Management Official, and Confidential Management/Program Analyst Performance Agreements, Forms 12450-A, B, and D, consisting of a summary narrative, critical performance expectations ratings, and a summary rating evaluation."

A valid performance appraisal used as a rating of record contains the signatures of the rating official/rater and recommending/approving official and has been provided to the employee.
The performance appraisal must contain an overall summary rating level and a Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers rating and be based on the evaluation of actual job performance for the designated appraisal period.
"Within-Grade Increase (WIGI) – A WIGI is synonymous with the term ""step increase'"" used in 5 U.S.C."
"§ 5335, and means: (1) A periodic increase in an employee's rate of basic pay from one step of the grade of his or her position to the next higher step of that grade in accordance with 5 U.S.C."

Approved CJE performance plans may be found in the CJE Resource Center at https://irsgov.sharepoint.com/sites/EmployeeResources/SitePages/CareerOpportunities6.aspx?OR=Teams-HL&CT=1697136730253&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiIyNy8yMzA5MDExMjIyOSIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D.
"6.430.2.2.1 (06-12-2009)
Retention Standard for the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers
(1) The Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (RRA ’98), Section 1204, requires all IRS employees to be evaluated on the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
This requirement has been incorporated into a Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers that is the same for all employees.
"(2) For information on Discussing The Retention Standard for the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers, see IRM 6.430.2.2.5 and Exhibit 6.430.2-1."
"6.430.2.2.2 (10-28-2011)
Preparing for the Performance Appraisal Cycle
(1) The supervisor reviews the employee’s assigned standard position description (SPD), verifying that it accurately reflects the assigned duties."
"If it does not, the supervisor contacts the Human Capital Office (HCO), Position Management/Classification for assistance in identifying the appropriate SPD or developing a new one."
"(2) In most cases, the supervisor will start with an existing performance plan that is appropriate for the employee’s position."
"However, the supervisor may need to obtain a new performance plan if appropriate CJEs and performance aspects for the employee’s SPD do not exist."
"In the latter case, the supervisor contacts the business unit representative for guidance in obtaining the appropriate performance plan from the CJE Resource Center at https://irsgov.sharepoint.com/sites/EmployeeResources/SitePages/CareerOpportunities6.aspx?OR=Teams-HL&CT=1697136730253&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiIyNy8yMzA5MDExMjIyOSIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D."
"Note: See IRM 6.430.2.2.3, Developing or Revising CJE Performance Plans, and Exhibit 6.430.2-2 for the procedure that must be followed when developing CJEs."
"(3) The performance of bargaining unit and non-bargaining unit employees assigned to the following supervisory codes are evaluated against CJEs and performance aspects:

6 (Work leaders)

7 (Team leaders when leading employees on CJEs)

8 (All other positions)

The supervisory code is found on the employee’s SPD and controls the appropriate performance plan."
"(4) The supervisor must annotate the accuracy of the SPD on Form 6774, Receipt of Critical Job Elements and Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers Retention Standard, each year."
"If the SPD is no longer accurate, the supervisor should contact their business unit for further guidance."
"(5) The supervisor reviews the employee position specific CJE performance plan, which is composed of the CJEs and performance aspects describing the ""Meets,"" ""Exceeds,"" and ""Fails"" levels."
The CJE performance plans may be found in the CJE Resource Center at https://irsgov.sharepoint.com/sites/EmployeeResources/SitePages/CareerOpportunities6.aspx?OR=Teams-HL&CT=1697136730253&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiIyNy8yMzA5MDExMjIyOSIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D.
"(6) All CJE performance plans, including any new or revised performance plans, are approved and controlled by the HCO, Performance Management and Recognition office."
"6.430.2.2.3 (10-28-2011)
Developing or Revising CJE Performance Plans
(1) The CJE performance plans are developed by teams of subject matter experts (SMEs) using the following process:

The significant tasks for each position covered by the performance plan are identified by job analysis

The significant tasks are aligned with one of the following four balanced measures CJEs: Customer Satisfaction-Knowledge; Customer Satisfaction-Application; Business Results-Quality, or Business Results-Efficiency

No tasks are aligned to the Employee Satisfaction-Employee Contribution CJE since this CJE remains the same for all positions

The significant tasks aligned to a CJE are grouped into similar areas known as performance aspects

Performance levels for ""Meets,"" ""Exceeds,"" and ""Fails"" are developed for each performance aspect

(2) Business units must ensure the above process is followed when new CJE performance plans are developed or existing performance plans are revised."
"(3) Since CJE performance plans and performance aspects are intended to be as cross functional as possible, business units should coordinate development of a new or revised CJE performance plan with other divisions or functions that may use that plan."
(4) Business units must perform a complete job analysis when creating or modifying performance plans.
"This job analysis should include the following documentation:

A copy of the applicable SPDs

Major job requirements (should be highlighted in the body of the SPD and described in more detail on a separate sheet if the description in the SPD is inadequate)

The knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) that are required to perform the identified major job requirements and are important in evaluating candidates

An explanation of the linkage of the listed KSAs to the new or modified CJE performance aspects

The name, title, pay plan/series/grade, signature, and signature date for SMEs responsible for job analysis validity (two or more recommended)

The name, signature, and signature date of the reviewing human resources specialist

(5) The HCO, Performance Management and Recognition office will retain this written record including the job analysis and supporting documentation for as long as the CJE performance plan is current."
"(6) Business units must submit the new or revised performance plans to the HCO, Performance Management and Recognition office, for review and approval."
"(7) After approval, the HCO, Performance Management and Recognition office will provide a copy of the new or revised CJE performance plans covering bargaining unit employees to the HCO’s Labor/Employee Relations & Negotiations division for inclusion as part of the notice process as specified in the National Agreement (Document 11678)."
(8) The National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) will be given the opportunity to bargain impact and implementation before the new or revised CJE performance plans for bargaining unit employees are put into effect.
"(9) The HCO will forward the approved performance plans to Media and Publications, Publishing Services, to be put into the proper format and retained in the Electronic Publishing Product Catalog."
Note: See Exhibit 6.430.2-2 for more information on developing and documenting new or revised CJE performance plans and performance aspects.
"6.430.2.2.4 (01-01-2007)
Establishing the Appropriate CJE Performance Plan
(1) Establishing the appropriate CJE performance plan is a three-step process that includes:

Identifying the appropriate CJE performance plan

Sharing and discussing the CJE performance plan with the employee

Finalizing the CJE performance plan

6.430.2.2.4.1 (01-01-2007)
Identifying the Appropriate CJE Performance Plan
(1) Normally performance plans are developed and used for each of the positions in the same career ladder."
Career ladder positions are usually identified in the SPD and the vacancy announcement.
"(2) When employees at different grade levels of the same occupation (e.g., Revenue Agents, Management Analysts) share the same CJE performance plans, the supervisor should clearly convey the expectations for the employee’s specific grade level to each employee covered by the shared CJEs."
"6.430.2.2.4.2 (10-28-2011)
Sharing and Discussing the CJE Performance Plan
(1) Sharing the performance plan with the employee timely is critical."
"The supervisor’s assessment of an employee against their CJE performance plan serves as the basis for several actions, including: within-grade increase (WGI), promotion, recognizing and rewarding the employee, determining employee development needs, helping the employee improve, resolving performance deficiencies, or taking performance actions on an employee who continues to perform at a less than ""Fully Successful"" level."
"(2) The supervisor must meet with the employee within 30 days of the beginning of the employee’s appraisal period or when the employee is assigned to a new position that is expected to last at least 60 days or longer (e.g., temporary promotion, detail)."
This timeframe ensures the employee has sufficient time to understand the supervisor’s expectations for job performance and what performance is needed to achieve a specific rating.
"(3) The process of providing a CJE performance plan ensures the supervisor identifies, determines, and discusses with each employee current and future projects and timeframes to meet the Service’s mission."
"This is accomplished with the supervisor and employee discussing goals, objectives and the role the employee will play in meeting and or exceeding those goals and objectives."
"Assignments will relate to long-term and short-term Servicewide, division, and/or other organizational performance initiatives."
(4) The supervisor should discuss how the employee’s CJE performance plan links to the organizational work plans and balanced measures.
"Note: For additional information see IRM 1.5.2, Managing Statistics in a Balanced Measurement System, Uses of Section 1204 Statistics."
"(5) The supervisor should encourage the employee to come to the meeting with preliminary ideas of how the employee can contribute to the overall success of the IRS mission, strategic business goals, and business plan."
"(6) The supervisor and employee should discuss the organizational resources (e.g., funding, staffing, training) needed to support the accomplishment of each CJE."
"In most cases, no additional resources will be needed."
(7) The supervisor will determine the type of meeting to discuss the CJE performance plans.
"These meetings will be held as a group meeting, or as a one-on-one session."
"The supervisor will ensure the following items are available during the meeting:

Form 6774, Receipt of Critical Job Elements and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers Retention Standard

CJE performance plan

Business unit and group’s workplans as appropriate

(8) Each NTEU chapter whose bargaining unit members are attending the meeting should be provided reasonable notification and an opportunity to attend the meeting subject to the provisions of the National Agreement (Document 11678)."
"(9) In accordance with the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (RRA ’98), the supervisor must discuss the Retention Standard for the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers regardless of whether the employee has regular dealings with taxpayers."
"Note: See Exhibit 6.430.2-1 and on iManage, see the Retention Standard for Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers at https://irsgov.sharepoint.com/sites/iManage/SitePages/Employees-Evaluated-by-CJEs-Policy,-Guidance,-and-Memoranda.aspx?OR=Teams-HL&CT=1697137314414&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiIyNy8yMzA5MDExMjIyOSIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D."
"6.430.2.2.4.3 (10-05-2017)
Finalizing the CJE Performance Plan
(1) After discussing the performance plan with the employee, the supervisor and the employee sign Form 6774, Receipt of Critical Job Elements and Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers Retention Standard."
This form acknowledges receipt of the performance plan and Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers and discussion between the supervisor and the employee.
"(2) Annually, the supervisor and the employee must sign (or initial) and date Form 6774, Receipt of Critical Job Elements and Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers Retention Standard."
"Both managers and employees have the option of signing using the digital signature feature built into the form, but bargaining unit employees must also be given the option of signing the form manually and returning the hard copy to the manager."
The digital signature must display either the signer’s name or Standard Employee Identifier (SEID).
"If there is no digital signature that displays the signer’s name or SEID, the form must be signed manually."
"Note: Proxy signatures are not permitted on official performance documentation

(3) If the CJEs have not changed for a journey level or above employee, the supervisor need not meet with the employee regardless of bargaining unit status, but must communicate that the CJE performance plan remains the same for the CJEs have not changed for an appraisal period."
"Even if the supervisor does not hold the CJE meeting, the supervisor and the employee still must sign or initial and date a new Form 6774, Receipt of Critical Job Elements and Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers Retention Standard for the upcoming appraisal period."
"(4) When an employee returns to their permanent position during the same appraisal year following a temporary assignment, a new CJE performance plan is not required."
The supervisor for the employee's permanent position reinstates the performance plan previously in effect.
The time previously accrued under that performance plan counts toward the 60 day period for determining rating eligibility.
"(5) When an employee returns to duty from an absence that began during a previous appraisal period, the supervisor and employee must sign and date a new Form 6774, Receipt of Critical Job Elements and Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers Retention Standard."
"(6) The supervisor ensures the CJE performance plan, the signed Form 6774, Receipt of Critical Job Elements and Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers Retention Standard, and the employee’s SPD are filed in the Employee Performance Folder (EPF), and provides the employee with a copy of each."
"6.430.2.2.4.4 (10-28-2011)
Changes to the CJE Performance Plan or Employee Expectations
(1) Any changes made to an existing performance plan must be coordinated with the divisions or functions before final approval by the HCO, and must be submitted by the HCO to the National Headquarters, NTEU, as required by the National Agreement (Document 11678) for bargaining unit positions."
"(2) If the supervisor finds it necessary to make a minor change (such as when a task is inapplicable to a performance aspect) to the CJE performance plan during the appraisal period, the supervisor should discuss the changes with the employee as soon as feasible."
"These changes may be necessitated by organizational, environmental, personal, or other conditions."
"The supervisor must document the changes, file the original in the employee's EPF, and provide a copy to the employee."
(3) Changes in CJE performance plans or expectations against an established performance plan should be finalized at least 60 days before the end of the employee's appraisal period to avoid having to extend the appraisal period.
"6.430.2.2.5 (06-12-2009)
Discussing The Retention Standard for the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers
(1) The supervisor must discuss with the employee behaviors that allow the employee to meet the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers as well as, circumstances that may result in a determination that the employee does not meet the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers, and the potential impact of not meeting the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"Exhibit 6.430.2-1 provides examples of behavior that may result in a ""Met"" or ""Not Met"" rating."
See Exhibit 6.430.2-1.
"(2) Discussion of the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers will include:

An explanation of the requirements of the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers in relationship to the employee’s job expectations

The potential impacts of not meeting the standard

Avoidance of, use of the words ""deliberately"" or ""intentionally"" in describing behavior that does not meet the standard

An explanation of why infrequent lapses that are inadvertent or unavoidable will not result in a ""Not Met"" rating

An explanation of why a ""Met"" or ""Not Applicable"" rating will have no effect on the overall rating, ranking in merit promotion actions, or entitlement to performance awards

An explanation of why a ""Not Met"" rating for the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers will result in an ""Unacceptable"" overall rating."
"An ""Unacceptable"" overall rating makes the employee ineligible for a performance award, WGI, career ladder promotion, competition for promotion, or satisfactory completion of a probationary period, and may result in the employee’s removal from the position and/or the IRS."
"An ""Unacceptable"" overall rating will also adversely affect an employee’s retention standing in a reduction in force

Note: See Exhibit 6.430.2-1 and on iManage, see the Retention Standard for Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers at https://irsgov.sharepoint.com/sites/iManage/SitePages/Employees-Evaluated-by-CJEs-Policy,-Guidance,-and-Memoranda.aspx?OR=Teams-HL&CT=1697137314414&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiIyNy8yMzA5MDExMjIyOSIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D."
"6.430.2.3 (06-12-2009)
Step 2: Monitoring Progress
(1) During this step, the supervisor continuously monitors the employee’s progress against the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers and CJE performance plan and performance aspects, notes areas of significant achievement, identifies deficiencies, and initiates corrective actions."
"6.430.2.3.1 (10-28-2011)
Monitoring the Performance Plan
(1) The supervisor should monitor the employee's performance plan through the following:

Observes and documents employee behavior and performance during the appraisal period

Documents observations as they happen because recalling specific past behavior and performance is often difficult

Documents observations in sufficient detail to be understood by another supervisor."
"The manner in which performance is documented should be consistent for all employees and should not include comparing one employee to another

Focuses on specific actions the employee took to accomplish CJEs and does not evaluate personality traits

Cites performance or outcomes, not conduct or general impressions

Focuses on performance as it relates to the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers and progress toward achieving CJEs

Provides ongoing feedback and coaching to the employee

(2) Supervisors should avoid:

Delaying the documentation of an employee’s performance

Comparing employees against one another

Evaluating an employee’s personality traits

Citing the employee’s conduct or general impressions of the employee

(3) The supervisor may NOT use Records of Tax Enforcement Results (ROTERs) in monitoring progress against CJEs."
ROTERs do not convey how an employee performed in relation to requirements of the CJE performance plan.
"Note: For additional information on ROTERs, see IRM 1.5.2, Managing Statistics in a Balanced Measurement System, Uses of Section 1204 Statistics."
(4) The supervisor should keep performance data organized in the EPF.
All documents used in formulating an evaluation must be shared with the employee prior to placing it in the employee’s EPF.
Supervisors must share any written evaluative recordation with bargaining unit employees within time periods established in the National Agreement (Document 11678).
"If not, it cannot be used as evaluative recordation."
"Note: For additional information on the EPF, see IRM 6.430.2.3.5."
"6.430.2.3.2 (10-28-2011)
Conducting Progress Reviews
(1) The supervisor observes the employee’s performance on a regular basis throughout the employee’s appraisal period."
"(2) At a minimum, the supervisor must conduct a mandatory mid-year progress review on the requirements of the CJE performance plan."
The mid-year progress review is a review of the employee’s work based on observation of behaviors related to the CJE performance plan for the position.
The mid-year progress review generally occurs at the mid point of the appraisal period and must include a discussion on progress in meeting expectations (CJEs and the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers).
"While the supervisor should, at a minimum, discuss each performance aspect whose performance has changed from the previous rating of record, there is no requirement to assign a ""Meets,"" ""Exceeds,"" or ""Fails"" rating to each performance aspect."
"In addition, the supervisor is not required to provide numerical ratings for the CJEs or the overall rating during the mid-year progress review."
"(3) The supervisor should provide meaningful feedback, relating it specifically to CJEs, opportunities for improvement, and the manner in which progress is being achieved."
"The supervisor should also cite outcomes and specific examples and offer feedback when it can be discussed and when it is most useful, that is as soon as the work is completed or before the employee will be doing a similar task."
The supervisor should also coach the employee in ways to improve performance.
The supervisor should combine formal and informal feedback often throughout the appraisal period to highlight changes in performance and next steps.
Monthly or quarterly one-on-one sessions may be appropriate in addition to the mandatory mid-year progress review.
(4) The supervisor should combine formal and informal feedback often throughout the appraisal period to highlight changes in performance and next steps.
Monthly or quarterly one-on-one sessions may be appropriate in addition to the mandatory mid-year progress review.
(5) All performance recordations and discussions must be documented and shared with the employee prior to being filed in the EPF.
Any employee comments concerning the recordations must also be filed in the EPF.
The date the progress review was conducted should be noted on the performance appraisal form.
Supervisors must share any written progress reviews with bargaining unit employees within time periods established in the National Agreement (Document 11678).
"If not, they cannot be used as evaluative recordation."
"(6) If the supervisor notes that an employee’s performance has declined from the previous appraisal period, the supervisor must note it and conduct a counseling session with the employee."
"Although performance feedback is always encouraged, supervisors are not required to notify a non bargaining unit employee prior to lowering the employee's average CJE score from the previous annual rating."
"Note: For more information concerning a decrease in performance of an employee, see Acknowledging Decreased Work Performance in IRM 6.430.2.3.3."
"(7) Generally, employees may not grieve progress reviews until they are used in the annual rating of record."
This is because the supervisor may change their evaluation of performance before the end of the appraisal period and the performance documentation may not be used in the performance appraisal.
Grievances filed before that time would be premature.
"However, an employee may attach documentation regarding matters of concern to their progress review."
Exception: A bargaining unit employee may grieve a mid-year progress review or other evaluation recordation if that recordation has been used by management as the basis for denying the employee a benefit such as the ability to work overtime or continue on an alternative work schedule (AWS).
"6.430.2.3.3 (01-01-2007)
Acknowledging Decreased Work Performance
(1) It is the supervisor’s responsibility to inform the employee whenever a decrease in work performance is observed either from the prior year’s appraisal or from the mid-year progress review."
"A decrease in performance necessitating supervisory involvement normally refers to the decline of one or more rating levels (i.e.,"" Exceeds Fully Successful"" to"" Fully Successful"")."
"In this event, the following steps may be taken:

Identify any area or areas of decreased performance that are related to the CJEs and performance aspects of the employee’s performance plan

Discuss with the employee the decrease in performance or any performance deficiencies identified, including the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers

Fully document, in writing, the specific examples of decreased performance and the associated aspects that were observed and any discussions with the employee about them."
"This documentation should be filed in the employee’s EPF

Discuss recommendations for improved work performance with the employee."
"This may include identifying and providing supplemental training or reading, on-the-job training, and other developmental activities, as appropriate, to help improve employee performance, especially when performance falls below the ""Meets"" level in one or more aspects

Continue to monitor the employee’s work performance until the work performance improves."
"Frequently review and discuss work performance with the employee

If performance is below the ""Fully Successful"" level and the employee does not improve their performance, continue to hold progress reviews to provide the employee an opportunity to raise the level of their work performance

Note: Employees who are rated below ""Fully Successful ""are not eligible for WGI."
"See IRM 6.430.2.5.4, Within-Grade Increase (WGI) Determination, for more information and for more information on WGI determinations for bargaining unit employees, see the National Agreement (Document 11678)."
"6.430.2.3.4 (10-28-2011)
Marginal and Unacceptable Performance
(1) Supervisors must provide assistance to employees at any time during the appraisal period that performance is determined to be ""Minimally Successful"" or ""Unacceptable"" in one or more CJEs or the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"(2) The supervisor must consult with their servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office regarding any performance rating of ""Unacceptable"" or ""Minimally Successful"" to ensure that all parties understand the implications of failing to improve."
"(3) Employees who do not meet the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers, or are performing below ""Minimally Successful"" in any of the CJEs should be counseled as early as possible in the appraisal period."
"Failure to improve or to sustain at least a"" Minimally Successful"" rating could impact an employee’s ability to remain in their position."
"(4) Before a supervisor begins the formal process of taking a performance based action, the supervisor needs to be aware that they have certain options."
"The law provides for two different processes for taking performance based actions:

If a performance based action is taken under 5 CFR Part 432, a formal opportunity to improve is required

If a performance based action is taken under the adverse action procedures of 5 CFR Part 752, an opportunity period is not required

Note: Regardless of the process used, the supervisor must contact the servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office for assistance."
"(5) ""Unacceptable"" ratings must be reviewed and approved by an official higher than the rating official."
"(6) When an employee's performance fails to meet established performance expectations at an acceptable level (i.e., ""Minimally Successful"") in one or more CJEs or the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers, the supervisor must notify the employee in writing."
"This notice must advise the employee of the following:

That their performance is unacceptable

Which CJE(s) are not being performed in an acceptable manner

What is required to perform at the rating level of ""Fully Successful"" or above

Any assistance that will be provided to the employee

What the reasonable period to demonstrate acceptable performance will be

Failure to perform at an acceptable performance level may result in removal, reduction in grade, withholding of a WGI, or reassignment depending upon the performance factors

(7) The employee must be provided a minimum of 60 days during which to raise their work performance to an acceptable level."
"While a rating of record showing the ""Unacceptable"" performance is not required at this time, the supervisor must communicate to the employee in writing the specifics for the ""Unacceptable"" rating."
"(8) If an employee’s performance does not improve to an acceptable level (i.e., Minimally Successful), an adverse action may result (e.g., reduction in grade, reassignment, or removal)."
The supervisor must contact the servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office before initiating any formal performance based action.
"Note: For additional information, see IRM 6.432.1, Addressing Poor Performance."
"(9) If the employee demonstrates acceptable performance during the opportunity period, the rating official retains the notice of unacceptable performance in the EPF for one year from the date the opportunity period became effective."
"In accordance with 5 USC Section 4303(d) if, because of performance improvement by the employee during the notice period, the employee is not reduced in grade or removed, and the employee's performance continues to be acceptable for one year from the date of the advance written notice, any entry or other notation of the unacceptable performance for which the action was proposed must be removed from any record, manual and automated, relating to the employee

The rating official is responsible for removing and destroying such records from the EPF and for initiating removal from the Service’s automated personnel records

(10) Saving Provision – Any administrative action initiated (e.g., an action taken against ""Unacceptable"" employees under 5 USC Section 4303) must continue to be processed consistent with the procedures and requirements of the program in effect when the action was initiated."
"(11) A rating of ""Minimally Successful"" or ""Unacceptable"" will also lead to the employee’s ineligibility to receive a WGI, career ladder promotion, or to complete their probationary period."
"Note: See IRM 6.531.1, Pay Under the General Schedule and IRS Payband System, for more information."
"6.430.2.3.5 (10-28-2011)
Employee Performance File (EPF)
(1) The EPF is a system consisting of all performance ratings and other performance-related records maintained on an employee in accordance with 5 CFR Part 293, Subpart D.

(2) Management is responsible for creating records concerning employee performance and maintaining them in accordance with the Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act regulations."
"(3) At a minimum, the EPF should contain forms and documents which:

Record and support the performance appraisal and individual performance plans

Are used by the supervisor to recommend a personnel action affecting an employee when the basis for the action is performance related

Are furnished in support of recommended actions and the agency’s final decision on the matter

Note: Other types of documents and forms may include Individual Development Plans (IDPs), recommendations for training that are performance-related, and copies of supervisory counseling session records resulting in performance based personnel actions

(4) The following documents must be maintained for four years:

Form 6850-BU, Bargaining Unit Performance Appraisal and Recognition Election; Form 6850-NBU, Non Bargaining Unit Performance Appraisal; or previous editions

The CJE performance plan document

Progress review(s) documentation

Employee self-assessments

Documented workload reviews, case file reviews, and job visitations

Any other documentation that supports the performance rating

Form 6774, Receipt for Critical Job Elements and Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers Retention Standard

(5) The supervisor must keep performance records in the EPF as long as necessary, if needed in connection with a grievance, appeal, or judicial proceeding."
"(6) For employees who are permanently changing positions within the IRS, the supervisor will ensure the employee’s entire EPF is forwarded to the gaining supervisor."
"(7) For employees who are accepting outside employment and leaving the IRS, who are accepting employment with another government agency, or who are resigning or retiring from IRS the supervisor must remove all of the ratings of record completed within the last four years from the separating employee’s EPF, attach these ratings of record to Form 3210, Document Transmittal, and forward the package to the following address:

Internal Revenue Service - OPF Consolidation Site
440 Space Center Drive
Lee's Summit, MO 64064
(8) The National Archives and Records Administration staff will ensure the ratings of record with appropriate CJE performance plan documents are filed in the Official Personnel Folder (OPF) before being sent to the Federal Records Center, if the employee resigns or to the gaining agency if the employee transfers."
"(9) Supervisors must destroy any remaining performance related documents unless such records are needed in connection with a grievance, appeal, or judicial proceeding."
"6.430.2.4 (01-01-2007)
Step 3: Evaluating Performance
(1) During this step, the supervisor completes the employee’s performance appraisal and conducts a performance appraisal meeting with the employee."
"6.430.2.4.1 (10-28-2011)
The Annual Performance Appraisal Process
(1) All employees who have served the minimum appraisal period of 60 calendar days are entitled to an annual performance appraisal that becomes the rating of record."
(2) Permanent supervisors complete the annual performance appraisals for employees under their authority.
(3) Employees who are temporarily promoted or detailed to a supervisory position have the authority to complete the annual performance appraisals for employees under their supervision.
There is no minimum period of time required for this authority.
"(4) The employee’s performance must have been observed a minimum of 60 days in the appraisal period by any supervisor who was responsible for assigning, reviewing, and evaluating the employee's work."
"However, it is not necessary for the employee's current supervisor to have observed the employee’s performance under a signed performance plan for 60 days or more."
"(5) The supervisor should consider the following when evaluating performance for an annual appraisal:

Position description

CJE performance plan (CJEs and performance aspects)

Mid-year and other progress reviews

Employee’s work products (management briefings, memos)

Employee’s self-assessment

Feedback from coworkers, taxpayers, and other customers

Team assignments and contributions to work group

Special achievements

Note: For more information on the various reasons for performance appraisals, see Exhibit 6.430.2-3."
"6.430.2.4.2 (01-01-2007)
Appraisal Period
(1) Bargaining unit and non bargaining unit employees covered by CJE performance plans are evaluated in accordance with a schedule based on the employee’s last digit of their Social Security Number (SSN)."
The schedule for appraisal periods and due dates is shown in the National Agreement (Document 11678).
"(2) In addition, an appraisal period will begin each time an employee is assigned to a new position for at least 60 days (e.g., temporary promotions, details, projects, or task forces) or issued a new CJE performance plan."
"(3) If the employee has not been observed by the current or another supervisor for 60 days on their performance plan at the time the employee's annual rating is due, the supervisor must:

Ensure that a performance plan has been issued

Ensure that the employee has signed the performance plan

Postpone any rating until the employee’s performance has been observed for a minimum of 60 days

Use the employee’s existing rating of record as the current rating of record until the new appraisal is prepared

(4) A new performance plan is not required for an employee returning to their permanent position following a temporary personnel action if the employee is returning during the same appraisal cycle."
"In this case, the supervisor of the employee’s permanent position may reinstate the performance plan previously in effect rather than complete a new performance plan."
The time previously accrued under the original performance plan would count toward the 60 day period for rating eligibility.
"6.430.2.4.2.1 (10-28-2011)
Performance Appraisal Due Dates
(1) The supervisor must complete the employee's annual appraisal for both bargaining unit and non bargaining unit employees within the scheduled time limits shown in the National Agreement (Document 11678), provided the employee has been observed for 60 days or more against their signed performance plan during the appraisal period."
Note: See Exhibit 6.430.2-4 for more information on performance appraisal due dates.
(2) The supervisor must follow their business unit’s procedures for ensuring that the employee’s annual appraisal is entered into the Service’s automated performance appraisal system.
(3) Departure appraisals are required for temporary assignments of 60 days or more during the appraisal period.
These appraisals should be completed within 30 days after the employee completes the temporary assignment and should be forwarded to the supervisor responsible for assigning the overall rating.
"Note: For more information concerning departure appraisals, see the discussion on departure appraisals in IRM 6.430.2.5.1, IRM 6.430.5, and Exhibit 6.430.2-4."
"6.430.2.4.2.2 (10-28-2011)
Extension of the Appraisal Period
(1) When an annual rating of record cannot be prepared at the specified time, the appraisal period shall be extended for the minimum appraisal period of 60 days to meet the conditions necessary to complete a rating of record."
"(2) To extend the appraisal period, the employee must be in work status on the appraisal period ending date and have some performance under a signed performance plan during the appraisal year."
The supervisor must decide to extend the employee’s appraisal year on or before the employee’s appraisal period ending date.
"(3) The employee is ""Not Ratable"" if all of the following conditions exist:

The employee has less than 60 days performance under a signed performance plan during the appraisal year

The employee’s appraisal period has ended

The employee is not in work status on the appraisal period ending date

Note: See IRM 6.430.2.5.5 for more information on ""Not Ratable"" determinations."
"(4) Examples of extension situations include but are not limited to:

To meet the 60 day minimum performance appraisal period."
For non bargaining unit employees only - The supervisor should not extend the appraisal period of a newly-hired NBU employee solely to provide the employee with a rating of record.
"In that event, the employee is ""Not Ratable"" for the appraisal period."
"Note: For more information on ""Not Ratable"" determinations, see IRM 6.430.2.5.5."
"To provide a new supervisor an opportunity to observe an employee’s performance against current requirements when information concerning the employee’s past performance is not available

To appraise an employee whose overall performance has been less than acceptable due to personal circumstances, (e.g., extended illness or other circumstances) and there is evidence of improvement in the employee’s performance

To provide a performance improvement period to an employee who was previously notified of failure to meet one or more performance standards

(5) An extension of the appraisal period will not affect the next appraisal ""period covered"" ending date; however, the starting date of the next appraisal period begins after the extension ends."
"(6) When the appraisal period is extended, the supervisor shall immediately inform the employee and the reviewing official."
(7) The supervisor must follow their business unit’s procedures for ensuring that the employee’s annual appraisal is entered into the Service’s automated performance appraisal system after the extended appraisal period is completed and the rating of record is assigned.
"6.430.2.4.2.3 (01-01-2007)
Dates on the Performance Appraisal Form
(1) The supervisor should accurately annotate the appraisal period on the appraisal form."
"(2) The date that the annual appraisal period ends will normally be the ""to"" date under period covered on the performance agreement form."
"(3) If an employee's departure from a permanent position is within 60 days from the date the appraisal period ends, the ""to"" date should reflect the actual departure date since that date reflects the date the employee actually departed their position."
(4) The entire appraisal period including any extensions necessary should be indicated under the period covered.
"6.430.2.4.3 (06-12-2009)
Employees Serving Probationary Periods
(1) The supervisor should begin monitoring probationary employees immediately to determine if they are able to perform the work, and are otherwise suited for retention in their position."
"Although formal performance improvement plans are not required for probationary employees, the supervisor should provide the probationary employees who are not meeting their CJE performance plan with sufficient information to help them understand how they are failing and how they can improve."
(2) Probationary employees are included in the appraisal schedule shown in the National Agreement (Document 11678).
Their scheduled annual appraisal period is based on the last digit of their SSN.
"If the probationary employee has at least 60 days under a signed performance plan (Form 6774, Receipt of Critical Job Elements and Retention Standard) at the time the annual rating is due, the supervisor must prepare a Form 6850-BU or Form 6850-NBU even if the employee has not been in the position for a full year."
"(3) If the probationary employee's performance does not improve, then the supervisor should immediately begin action to terminate the employee from the position and/or Federal service."
"(4) Supervisors should consult with the servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office regarding any performance rating of ""Minimally Successful"" or ""Unacceptable"" to ensure that all parties understand the implications of failing to improve."
"(5) A rating of ""Fully Successful"" or higher, rendered early during the probationary period does not preclude a subsequent decision that the employee is not performing at the expected level, or is otherwise unsuitable to be retained."
"However, the supervisor should provide specific examples of how performance deteriorated after the rating was assigned if the decision to remove during probation is for unacceptable performance."
"6.430.2.4.4 (01-01-2007)
Minimum Appraisal Period for Full Time Union Representatives
(1) See the National Agreement (Document 11678) for more information."
"6.430.2.4.5 (10-15-2010)
Self-Assessments
(1) Self-assessments are narrative descriptions or lists of accomplishments that the employee develops for the annual rating to describe their realization of goals, objectives, achievements, and significant accomplishments or challenges during the specified appraisal period."
(2) An effective self-assessment describes the specific actions taken by the employee to accomplish work requirements identified by the CJE performance plan and the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers.
(3) Bargaining unit employees are not required to submit a self-assessment but should be encouraged to do so.
"(4) Within the last 30 days of the appraisal period, the supervisor should ask the employee to prepare a self-assessment."
"(5) A bargaining unit employee must be given up to four hours of official time to prepare a self-assessment, if the employee requests it."
This requirement has not been extended to non bargaining unit employees.
(6) Bargaining unit employees should submit their self-assessment to their immediate supervisor no later than the last workday of their appraisal cycle.
(7) Non bargaining unit employees should submit their self-assessment to their immediate supervisor by the date requested by their supervisor.
(8) The supervisor must consider the employee’s self-assessment when preparing the employee’s annual appraisal.
"(9) If the employee prepares a self-assessment, it should be attached to the employee’s revalidated annual appraisal for all purposes."
(10) Self-assessments are limited to four pages regardless of the format chosen.
"Employees may (but are not required to) use Form 13335, Performance Appraisal Self-Assessment Form in preparing and submitting a self-assessment."
Note: More information on writing self-assessments is found in the Performance Appraisal Self-Assessment Tutorial at https://publish.no.irs.gov/cat12.cgi?request=CAT2&itemtyp=D&itemb=11948&items=%2a.
"6.430.2.4.5.1 (01-01-2007)
Using ROTERs in Self-Assessments
(1) Using Records of Tax Enforcement Results (ROTERs) in self-assessments does not violate either Section 1204 of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 or the 26 CFR Part 801."
"(2) It is a violation of Section 1204, however, if a supervisor uses the ROTERs information from the employee’s self-assessment when evaluating the employee’s performance."
"(3) To dispel even the appearance of impropriety, employees should be encouraged to avoid using ROTERs in self-assessments."
"(4) For non bargaining unit employees only: If a non bargaining unit employee submits a self-assessment with ROTERs, it should be returned to the employee for removal of the ROTERs."
"Note: For additional information on ROTERs, see IRM 1.5.2, Managing Statistics in a Balanced Measurement System, Uses of Section 1204 Statistics."
"6.430.2.4.6 (10-28-2011)
Completing Appraisal Narratives
(1) Narratives can reinforce corporate values, particularly customer service."
It is beneficial to comment on significant accomplishments and narratives need to accurately reflect the employee’s performance for the appraisal period.
"(2) Normally, performance appraisal narratives should not exceed two single-spaced, typed pages."
There are situations when a narrative may not be required as discussed further in this section.
"(3) All documentation must be reviewed, considered, and summarized for work performed during the appraisal period."
"These documents support numerical ratings assigned, possible performance awards, merit promotion opportunities, and help to identify continuing educational needs."
(4) Supervisors should review each performance aspect and prepare a written narrative describing the level of performance for each applicable performance aspect.
The supervisor should write the narrative before assigning levels to performance aspects.
(5) The narrative should contain brief highlights of an employee’s performance for a specified appraisal period.
It must describe performance as it relates to the employee’s CJEs and for every performance aspect observed and serves as the basis for the overall rating.
"(6) Well-written narratives contain specific goals and objectives, examples of achievements, significant accomplishments and/or, if necessary, performance shortfalls of measurable and observable performance during the appraisal period."
"They should:

Be concise, but descriptive enough to give the next level reviewer an accurate picture of the strengths, development needs, and accomplishments of the employee in each CJE

Focus on what’s important for that particular job and the CJEs

Be clear about whether the employee ""Exceeds,"" ""Meets,"" or ""Fails"" each individual performance aspect

Ensure each CJE narrative is consistent with the focus of the CJE outlined in the performance plan

(7) Narratives must NOT contain Records of Tax Enforcement Results (ROTERs)."
"For additional information, see IRM 1.5.2, Managing Statistics in a Balanced Measurement System, Uses of Section 1204 Statistics."
(8) Narratives are permanent records that become part of the performance appraisal.
"(9) Once completed, the narratives must be attached to the performance appraisal form (Form 6850-BU or Form 6850-NBU)."
"6.430.2.4.6.1 (01-01-2007)
Determining the Requirement for a Narrative
(1) Narratives are required under the following situations:

When an employee is appraised on a new performance plan."
"In the merit promotion competitive process when a narrative was not completed at the time the employee received their annual rating, then the supervisor must write a narrative at the time the employee applies for a job."
If the supervisor lowers the rating of a CJE from the prior year's appraisal.
"For any CJE rated at the ""Fully Successful"" level or below."
"For a rating of ""Not Met"" in the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"If ""Not Applicable"" (N/A) is provided in lieu of a score for a performance aspect or CJE due to a lack of an opportunity to perform or observe performance in that area, the circumstances must be noted."
"(2) Narratives are not required under the following situations:

The employee is on the same performance plan as the prior year and the supervisor awards a ""4 ""or ""5"" in a CJE, and that same score or a lower score was awarded the prior performance appraisal period

The employee is applying through merit promotion for GS-8 and below positions in Submission Processing, Accounts Management, and Compliance Services

Employees in Submission Processing who receive measured ratings in quality and quantity provided by the Total Evaluation Performance System (TEPS)

(3) If the supervisor revalidates the prior year’s appraisal, the prior year’s narratives are still attached to the appraisal form and these narratives may be used for merit promotion purposes."
"If the employee applies for merit promotion and one or more CJE does not have a narrative, the supervisor must prepare new narratives for those CJEs that reflect performance for the appraisal period covered by the annual rating."
"Note: For more information about revalidated appraisals, see IRM 6.430.2.4.11."
"6.430.2.4.7 (01-01-2007)
Rating Performance Against The Retention Standard for the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers
(1) The supervisor must determine whether the employee has performed duties with potential impact on taxpayer issues or outcomes during the appraisal period."
"(2) If the employee has performed such duties, the supervisor must determine whether the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers has been ""Met."""
"(3) If a rating of ""Not Met"" is proposed, the supervisor must contact their servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office for guidance on developing a Performance Improvement Plan."
"Failure of the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers will result in an Overall Rating of ""Unacceptable."""
"(4) If the employee has not performed such duties the supervisor must check ""Not Applicable"" for the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers on Form 6850-BU and Form 6850-NBU."
"6.430.2.4.8 (01-01-2007)
Rating Performance Aspects
(1) Annual appraisals are completed on Form 6850-BU."
The supervisor lists each performance aspect under the appropriate CJE on the Form 6850-BU or Form 6850-NBU.
"(2) The supervisor evaluates the employee’s performance in each performance aspect and rates each aspect as ""Exceeds,"", ""Meets,"" or ""Fails""."
"(3) If the supervisor has not observed the employee’s performance in a performance aspect for the mandatory minimum time required or such information is not available from other supervisors for the minimum time required, the supervisor assigns a rating of ""Not Applicable""."
"Instances of ""Not Applicable"" should be rare and must be documented in the attached appraisal narrative."
"The ""Not Applicable"" designation should not be used when the employee has failed to perform the required tasks or duties because of performance restrictions based on safety, security, or integrity issues."
(4) The supervisor’s determination of the employee’s level of performance in each aspect determines the employee’s subsequent CJE score and overall rating.
"(5) The supervisor must always use careful judgment in determining if an employee has a rating of ""Exceeds,"" ""Meets,"" or ""Fails,"" in each performance aspect of the CJE."
"Normally, the supervisor should not allow one incident to unduly influence the rating of an aspect."
"In assigning the performance level, supervisors should consider the quality, quantity, and complexity of the assignment or task in relationship with the employee’s grade and skill level."
"(6) The employee must consistently perform all applicable tasks (performance standards) listed at the ""Exceeds"" rating level, including any additional tasks not found in the ""Meets"" level, in order to receive a rating of ""Exceeds"" for that aspect."
"6.430.2.4.9 (10-28-2011)
Rating CJEs
(1) The rating for each CJE will be based upon the ratings of all observed performance aspects of the CJE, using the following required scale:

CJE Rating

Numerical Scale

Definition

Outstanding

5

Exceeds all performance aspects of the CJE."
"Exceeds Fully Successful

4

Exceeds more than half of the performance aspects of the CJE and meets the other performance aspects."
"Fully Successful

3

Meets all of the performance aspects."
"Minimally Successful

2

Fails one performance aspect."
"Unacceptable

1

Fails two (2) or more performance aspects."
"Not Applicable

N/A

The supervisor has not observed performance of the duties/responsibilities reflected by the CJEs."
(2) The numerical scale above for each CJE is used to determine the average CJE score.
"While the average CJE score has no direct relationship to the overall rating, it is used as the basis for calculating bargaining unit performance awards."
"Note: CJEs deemed ""Not Applicable"" are excluded from the average CJE score calculation."
"6.430.2.4.10 (10-28-2011)
The Overall Rating
(1) Each annual performance appraisal will include an overall rating, as follows:

Overall Rating

Definition

Outstanding

Employee is rated ""Outstanding"" in more than half of the CJEs and ""Exceeds Fully Successful"" in the remainder of the CJEs, and receives a ""Met"" on the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"Exceeds Fully Successful

Employee is rated ""Exceeds Fully Successful"" or above in more than half of the CJEs and ""Fully Successful"" in the remainder of the CJEs, and receives a ""Met"" on the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"Fully Successful

Employee is rated ""Fully Successful"" or above in all of the CJEs, and receives a ""Met"" on the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"Minimally Successful

Employee is rated ""Minimally Successful"" in one or more CJEs but not ""Unacceptable"" in any CJE, and receives a ""Met"" on the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"Unacceptable

Employee is rated ""Unacceptable"" in one or more CJEs or receives a ""'Not Met'"" on the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"(2) If the employee has insufficient performance during the appraisal period to be assigned a rating of record, the employee will be designated ""Not Ratable ""for that period."
"Note: For additional information on Not Ratable determinations, see IRM 6.430.2.5.5

."
"(3) Overall ratings should be assigned at the end of the appraisal period for the annual performance appraisal and for other types of performance appraisals that become the employee’s rating of record, such as a departure appraisal within the last 60 days of the appraisal period."
(4) Supervisors should not assign overall ratings for other types of appraisals that do not become an employee’s rating of record.
Note: See Exhibit 6.430.2-3 for examples of other types of performance appraisals that may become ratings of record.
(5) The overall rating provides one rating for the combined performance against the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers and the CJEs and becomes the employee's rating of record.
(6) The supervisor should only assign the overall rating at the end of the appraisal period for an employee who is on a permanent assignment or who is on a temporary promotion at the end of the employee’s appraisal period and meets the conditions specified in IRM 6.430.5.3(2).
Note: See IRM 6.430.5 for more information about performance appraisals for temporary assignments.
(7) It is not necessary for the supervisor to have observed the employee’s performance under a signed performance agreement for 60 days or more.
"However, the employee’s performance must have been observed by at least one other supervisor under a signed agreement for a minimum of 60 days within the appraisal period."
"In rare cases, it may be necessary to extend the appraisal period until the minimum 60 days has been met."
(8) The reviewing official has the final authority on whether to approve the overall rating.
"6.430.2.4.11 (12-20-2023)
Revalidated Annual Appraisals
(1) Revalidated annual appraisals are not permitted for non-bargaining unit employees."
(2) The bargaining unit revalidation process requires the supervisor to conduct the same thorough review and evaluative process to determine if the rating of record remains exactly the same.
"(3) To revalidate an employee’s annual rating, the supervisor must determine that the employee would receive a rating of record for the current performance rating period identical to the rating of record for the previous period."
"Identical means that the ratings for the performance aspects, CJEs, and overall rating have not changed."
Note: OPM regulations do not permit the issuance of a rating of record that assumes a level of performance by an employee without an actual evaluation of that employee's performance.
"(4) To receive a revalidated appraisal, the employee must be at the journey level or above and at least in the second year of their position."
(5) The supervisor must advise the employee before revalidating an appraisal.
(6) The supervisor may revalidate a previous year’s annual rating even if the supervisor did not prepare the prior appraisal.
"(7) When revalidating an appraisal, supervisors are also revalidating the Retention Standard rating from the previous rating of record."
(8) The narratives that accompanied the previous appraisal being revalidated must be considered valid and must remain a component of the revalidated performance appraisal.
"If the supervisor wants to update the narrative, they must prepare a new appraisal instead of revalidating."
(9) The employee’s self-assessment is attached to the revalidated appraisal for all purposes.
"If the supervisor objects to the accuracy of a self-assessment, the supervisor may prepare a new appraisal with narratives."
If the supervisor decides not prepare a new appraisal it does not indicate they agree with the employee’s self–assessment.
(10) The supervisor must still conduct a performance discussion with the employee.
(11) A supervisor may revalidate a rating of record indefinitely for bargaining unit employees only.
"6.430.2.5 (10-28-2011)
Additional Reasons for Performance Appraisals
(1) Although the employee’s annual appraisal that becomes the employee’s rating of record is the most commonly given appraisal, other performance appraisals may be issued for specific circumstances."
(2) Some of these other performance appraisals may also be used as the employee’s rating of record as described below.
"Note: See Exhibit 6.430.2-3 for more information on additional reasons for performance appraisals, and IRM 6.430.5 for more information concerning performance appraisal requirements for temporary assignments."
"6.430.2.5.1 (10-28-2011)
Departure Appraisals
(1) A departure appraisal is a type of appraisal prepared when either the supervisor or employee moves from a permanent or temporary assignment to another permanent or temporary assignment."
(2) The employee's performance must have been observed under a signed performance plan for at least 60 days.
"(3) Each CJE is rated; however, an overall rating is not assigned unless the employee departs their position within 60 days of the end of the appraisal period or the supervisor departs their position within 60 days of the end of the employee’s appraisal period and the departure appraisal becomes the rating of record as discussed below."
"(4) Reasons for departure appraisals:

Supervisor departure - If a supervisor permanently departs their position, a departure appraisal must be prepared for all of the employees in the supervisor’s work unit."
The new supervisor will use this departure appraisal to prepare the employee’s rating of record when the employee’s appraisal period ends.
"Supervisor departure (last 60 days of the employee's appraisal period) - If a supervisor permanently departs their position during the last 60 days of the employee's appraisal period, the departure appraisal becomes the employee's rating of record."
The supervisor should assign an overall rating of record for these departure appraisals since the appraisal will be used as the rating of record.
"If a supervisor temporarily departs for a position during the last 60 days of the employee's appraisal period, that supervisor will be responsible for preparing the rating of record."
"Employee departure - If an employee departs their position with more than 60 days remaining in the appraisal period, the supervisor must prepare a departure appraisal for that employee."
The employee’s new supervisor will consider the departure appraisal when preparing the employee's next rating of record.
"Employee departure (last 60 days of appraisal period) - If the employee departs their position within the last 60 days of the employee’s appraisal period, the departure appraisal becomes the employee's rating of record."
The supervisor should assign an overall rating for these departure appraisals since the appraisal will be used as the rating of record.
"(5) If a supervisor is assigned to a new organization and the employee accompanies the supervisor to the new organization and will be occupying the same position, a departure rating is not required."
(6) The supervisor must sign the departure appraisal and provide a copy to the employee for the employee’s signature.
The reviewing official’s signature is not required unless the departure appraisal will become the employee’s rating of record.
"(7) All departure appraisals must either be sent to the employee’s new office (with the employee’s EPF), if the employee is changing positions, or be placed in the employee’s EPF when the supervisor changes positions."
(8) The rating official should consider all departure appraisals as input for preparation of the employee’s annual rating of record.
(9) Departure appraisals are not required for employees leaving the IRS and not going to other Federal employment.
"For example, departure appraisals are not required for employees who resign or retire."
(10) Departure appraisals are required for employees leaving the IRS for other Federal employment through transfer to other Federal agencies or reassignment to other Treasury bureaus and for employees accepting new appointments with the IRS or other Federal agencies.
"6.430.2.5.2 (06-12-2009)
Merit Promotion Appraisals (MPA)
(1) The employee's most recent rating of record within the last four years will be used for merit promotion in nearly all cases."
(2) A supervisor may prepare a new performance appraisal for merit promotion purposes when the employee is newly hired or has returned to duty after a lengthy absence and has no rating of record on file.
"To be provided a MPA after a lengthy absence, the employee must not have had at least 60 days of performance under a signed performance plan for the most recently completed appraisal period."
The newly hired employee must have been on board for at least 90 days after an initial appointment.
"In either instance, the employee must meet the minimum appraisal period requirements for the current appraisal period as specified in IRM 6.430.2.4.2."
(3) A MPA cannot be used as the employee's rating of record and is valid for all merit promotion actions until the employee receives an annual rating of record.
"(4) Since a MPA cannot become a rating of record, no reviewing official signature is required and no overall rating is assigned."
"(5) An employee who has served 90 days on a competitive appointment but has not served 60 cumulative days under a signed performance plan (e.g., seasonal employee or a full time union official) is considered ""Not Ratable"" for merit promotion purposes."
"These ""Not Ratable"" employees cannot receive any type of performance appraisal for merit promotion, even a ""presumptive"" Fully Successful appraisal."
"Employment offices cannot accept ""presumptive"" Fully Successful appraisals for merit promotion."
Note: See IRM 6.430.2.5.7 for more information on presumptive ratings.
"(6) The supervisor must use the following procedures to document that the employee is ""Not Ratable"" for merit promotion."
"The supervisor must complete Form 6850-BU or Form 6850-NBU, as appropriate, indicating that each performance aspect is N/A."
"The supervisor will indicate that the reason for the appraisal is ""Other"" and show the reason as ""Merit Promotion."""
"The period covered should indicate the employee’s actual work period, if any, during the current appraisal year

Since a MPA cannot become a rating of record, no reviewing official signature is required and no overall rating is assigned

A copy of the ""Not Ratable"" Form 6850-BU or Form 6850-NBU must be shared with the employee

The supervisor should submit this Form 6850-BU or Form 6850-NBU to the servicing Employment Office to document in the merit promotion file that the employee is ""Not Ratable""

(7) Bargaining unit employees only:

Before the supervisor submits an annual appraisal to the ranking panel/official to be used in a competitive action, the employee must have received it for at least three workdays to allow for the employee’s comments."
"The supervisor must attach any employee comments to the appraisal

If a supervisor failed to issue a timely and current performance appraisal for the merit promotion package, the employee may submit their self-assessment."
"This self-assessment cannot propose a summary rating higher than the employee's current rating of record

6.430.2.5.3 (01-01-2007)
Ad Hoc Performance Appraisals for Bargaining Unit Seasonal Employees
(1) The performance ranking process for the release and recall of bargaining unit seasonal employees is based on the employee's most recent annual performance appraisal."
"(2) In the absence of an annual appraisal, the supervisor will prepare an ad hoc performance appraisal for those employee's meeting the minimum appraisal period requirements."
(3) These ad hoc appraisals are only used for the release and recall of bargaining unit seasonal employees and cannot be used for the annual rating of record.
"Note: For more information, see the National Agreement (Document 11678), Article 12."
"6.430.2.5.4 (10-28-2011)
Within-Grade Increase (WGI) Determination
(1) The OPM regulations require that the decision to grant or deny a WGI must be supported by the employee’s most recent rating of record."
"If the most recent rating of record does not support the decision, a new rating must be prepared."
"(2) Examples of when a new rating of record is required:

A WGI has previously been denied and the employee’s performance has improved to the ""Fully Successful"" level, making the employee eligible for a WGI

If the most recent rating of record is at least ""Fully Successful"" but the employee’s performance has now decreased below that level, the supervisor must prepare a new rating of record to support the denial of the WGI

(3) This rating of record prepared to support or deny the WGI becomes the employee’s new rating of record for all purposes."
"Note: For more information on WGI determinations for bargaining unit employees, see the National Agreement (Document 11678 ), Article 17."
"6.430.2.5.5 (10-28-2011)
Not Ratable Determinations
(1) A supervisor may be unable to rate an employee at the end of the performance appraisal period, in which case no rating of record shall be recorded for the employee for that performance appraisal period."
"(2) Examples of ""Not Ratable"" situations include:

The employee was on extended leave and did not have at least 60 days of performance during the appraisal period."
The employee was not eligible for extension of the appraisal period as specified in IRM 6.430.2.4.2.2.
"For non bargaining unit employees only - The employee is newly-hired and does not have 60 days remaining in their performance appraisal period

The employee served as a full time union representative and does not have 120 hours of IRS direct work

The employee was detailed to a position excluded from the performance appraisal requirements in 5 CFR Part 430, by law, or other OPM regulation

(3) If the supervisor determines that the employee is ""Not Ratable"" at the end of the employee’s designated performance appraisal period, the supervisor must complete a Form 6850-BU or Form 6850-NBU and indicate in the overall rating block that the employee is ""Not Ratable"" and specify the reason for that determination in the space provided."
"(4) The supervisor will enter the ""Not Ratable"" designation into the automated personnel system to indicate that the employee could not be rated and to ensure that the employee is not shown as missing a rating of record."
"(5) In those cases where an employee cannot be rated, the employee may be granted a ""Waiver of Requirement for Determination"" for a WGI as specified in 5 CFR Section 531.409(d)."
"6.430.2.5.6 (01-01-2007)
Retroactive Appraisals
(1) The OPM regulations and IRS policy prohibit retroactive ratings of record."
"The OPM regulations (5 CFR Section 430.208(h)(i)) do not permit the assignment of a rating of record for an earlier appraisal period, if a rating has been assigned for a subsequent period or if the agency-established deadline for providing a rating of record has passed

It is the Service's policy that supervisors can prepare a rating of record up to 364 days following the end of the employee's appraisal period, unless a rating of record for a later period has been completed."
"Once that 364 day period has passed, no rating of record can be assigned for the previous appraisal period

(2) Exceptions to the restrictions on retroactive appraisals include appraisals changed as a result of:

A grievance, complaint or other formal proceedings permitted by law or regulation

When the Service determines that a rating of record was incorrectly recorded or calculated

6.430.2.5.7 (06-12-2009)
Presumptive Ratings
(1) Presumptive ratings, for ratings of record, are prohibited by 5 CFR Section 430.208 (a)(2)."
(2) A rating of record can be based only on the evaluation of actual job performance for the designated performance appraisal period.
A supervisor must not issue a rating of record that assumes a level of performance by an employee without an actual evaluation of that employee’s performance.
"6.430.2.6 (06-12-2009)
Conducting the Performance Appraisal Meeting
(1) The performance appraisal is final when it is issued to the employee with the appropriate reviews and signatures."
"Thus, the appraisal should not be discussed with the employee until all appropriate reviews and signatures have been completed."
(2) The supervisor as the rating official conducts a performance appraisal meeting with the employee after the reviewing official approves the appraisal.
This meeting must be completed in accordance with the schedule shown in the National Agreement (Document 11678).
"(3) The supervisor should begin the performance appraisal meeting by reviewing the employee's self-assessment (if prepared), focusing on the areas of agreement between the self-assessment and the evaluator's assessment of the employee's performance."
The focus of this meeting should not only be on the past performance but also on future performance and areas for improvement during the upcoming appraisal period.
"While it is important to document accomplishments and past performance, documentation should focus on ""lessons learned"" for improving future performance."
"(4) During the performance appraisal meeting, the supervisor must share a copy of the completed performance appraisal form with the employee and discuss openly the ratings and rationale for those ratings."
"For areas of disagreement, the supervisor must determine if information might have been overlooked."
"(5) At the conclusion of the performance appraisal meeting, the supervisor may decide that it would be useful to discuss the expectations for the next appraisal cycle at this time by conducting the activities outlined in IRM 6.430.2.2, Step 1: Planning Expectations."
Often a separate meeting is required to plan future performance goals and should be scheduled as soon as practical.
"(6) When conducting the performance appraisal meeting, the supervisor should:

Acknowledge the full range of performance observed."
"For example, give appropriate balance to satisfactory work while also identifying areas that could be improved

Cite specific examples to demonstrate current performance, as well as examples of behavior/outcomes that occur at the next higher level of performance

Focus on the future by jointly developing a plan of action to improve performance

Follow a problem-solving approach."
"Discuss key areas for improvement by defining specific solutions to performance issues without assigning blame

Manage the emotions involved with evaluating performance."
"Allow employee to vent, listen carefully to the concerns, and provide constructive feedback."
"In some cases, it may be useful to postpone the remainder of the meeting so both participants can regroup

."
"6.430.2.7 (06-12-2009)
Processing the Signed Performance Appraisal
(1) Both the rating official and reviewing official must sign the performance appraisal for it to be used as the rating of record."
"The reviewing official has the final authority on whether to approve, modify or disapprove the overall rating."
(2) The employee is not required to sign the performance appraisal.
"If the employee chooses not to sign, the supervisor should document the employee's refusal."
The supervisor should inform the employee that refusal to acknowledge receipt of the appraisal does not make the rating of record invalid.
"(3) The original, completed performance appraisal form must be filed in the employee’s EPF along with any back-up documentation, and any accompanying narratives or self-assessments."
(4) The supervisor must follow the business unit’s procedures for ensuring that the employee’s annual appraisal is entered into the Service’s automated performance appraisal system.
"6.430.2.8 (10-28-2011)
Tracking Performance Appraisals
(1) The supervisor should review and take actions based on the information provided in ePerformance or on the information provided in the Pay Period Performance Management Listings Reports available on the HR Reporting Center website."
"(2) ePerformance reports provide information to the supervisor related to performance management responsibilities including:

Printable Performance Plans

Award Election Report

Status Summary Report

Missing Performance Documents

Performance Document Status

Documents Pending Rating Review

(3) The Pay Period Performance Management Listings Reports are available to each supervisor and each business unit via the HR Reporting Center website."
Supervisors may initiate an OL5081 for access as appropriate for their business unit.
"These reports provide information to the supervisor related to performance management responsibilities including:

Annual ratings due/overdue status

Employee due/overdue eligibility status for WGI

Last rating of record and rating dates input in the automated personnel system."
"6.430.2.9 (10-28-2011)
Rebuttals and Grievances
(1) Employees are encouraged to resolve matters of disagreement concerning the overall ratings with their rating official and reviewing official."
"(2) An employee who is dissatisfied with the overall rating may ask for reconsideration from the rating official in lieu of, or in addition to, adding comments to the performance appraisal."
(3) Bargaining unit employees must follow the process outlined in the National Agreement (Document 11678) for requesting a review of their performance appraisals.
They should consult their NTEU steward.
(4) Non bargaining unit employees should follow the IRS Agency Grievance System procedures specified in IRM 6.771.1 to request reconsideration of their performance appraisals.
(5) Non bargaining unit employees may also consult their servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office to discuss appeal procedures.
Bargaining unit employees should consult their NTEU steward.
(6) Any change to the overall rating must be reviewed against the CJE performance plan to ensure the appropriateness of the changed rating.
"6.430.2.10 (06-12-2009)
Amending a Rating
(1) A rating may be amended after it is given to the employee for the following reasons:

Reconsideration by the rating official resulting from an informal request by the employee within 60 days of issuance

Discovery of an error in recording or calculating the rating of record

Changes directed via a formal complaint procedure

(2) A change in the employee's performance after the end of the appraisal period is not a justification for amending a rating."
"(3) The following steps should be followed to amend a rating of record:

The supervisor selects Rework Rating from the document in ePerformance

The appraisal period remains the same as the original

All parties of the original rating should sign the amended rating (employee, rating official, and reviewing official)

The amended rating must not contain documentation in any section of the form that would indicate the evaluation is the result of a grievance or any similar action."
"This includes the performance notes section of the online document

The original copy of the amended form should be placed in the employee’s EPF

The previous rating will be destroyed and replaced with the corrected rating

6.430.2.11 (01-01-2007)
Step 4: Recognizing Performance
(1) The supervisor may recognize strong performance through informal acknowledgements and formal recognition."
"Note: See IRM 6.451.1 Employee Performance and Utilization - Awards and Recognition or the Awards and Recognition

."
"Exhibit 6.430.2-1
Examples of the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers Retention Standard Behavior
Standard: Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers

Consistent with the incumbent's official responsibilities, administers the tax laws fairly and equitably, protects all taxpayers' rights, and treats them ethically with honesty, integrity, and respect."
"EXAMPLES OF PERFORMANCE THAT MEETS THE STANDARD:

As observed in case file or Integrated Data Retrieval System actions, through management monitoring of phone calls, and through feedback received from the taxpayer and other outside sources, the employee:

Responds to taxpayers in a timely manner."
"Identifies self by providing name and badge number, as required by RRA ‘98 Section 3705."
Protects taxpayer rights to privacy by following disclosure procedures.
Identifies taxpayers whose circumstances and/or account history meet Taxpayer Advocate case criteria.
Uses communication techniques that are appropriate for the listener’s level of understanding.
Advises taxpayers and their representatives of appeal rights and actions necessary to pursue and protect their rights.
"Conducts oral and written communications with taxpayers that are professional, courteous, and accurately state the facts."
"Takes or recommends appropriate actions in a timely fashion which will resolve taxpayer filing and payment delinquencies, addressing all issues with the taxpayer to ensure the taxpayer remains compliant."
Listens to and considers the taxpayer’s point of view.
"Identifies when action is required by another function to resolve the taxpayer’s issue/inquiry, and ensures that the transfer of contact is made in a timely manner."
"Advises taxpayers of full personal impact, such as interest and penalty accumulation, when taxpayers advise they cannot pay their liability in full."
"EXAMPLES OF PERFORMANCE THAT FAILS TO MEET THE STANDARD:

Note: The IRS has determined that infrequent lapses that are inadvertent or unavoidable should not result in a ""Not Met"" rating on the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"Instead, they will result in a discussion between the supervisor and employee to reinforce the importance of the standard and explore ways to prevent a recurrence."
"As observed in case file or Integrated Data Retrieval System actions, through management monitoring of phone calls, and through feedback received from the taxpayer and other outside sources, the employee:

Discusses specific taxpayer information with others who do not have an official ""need-to-know."""
Fails to identify taxpayers whose circumstances and/or account history meet Taxpayer Advocate case criteria.
"Provides oral and/or written responses containing wording or tone which is discriminatory, discourteous, disrespectful, intimidating; which misstate the facts; or are inappropriate to the taxpayer’s level of understanding."
Takes improper actions that place taxpayer in a hardship condition.
Does not follow installment agreement procedures when responding to installment agreement requests from taxpayers and their representatives.
"Does not apply appeal rights, or advise taxpayers and their representatives of those rights."
"Does not take or recommend appropriate actions that will resolve taxpayer filing and payment delinquencies, or consistently takes/recommends those actions in an untimely fashion, or fails to address all issues with the taxpayer to ensure that the taxpayer remains compliant."
"Does not convey personal impact information to taxpayers, such as penalty and interest accumulation, when the taxpayer advises they cannot pay their liability in full."
Fails to consider all relevant information provided by the taxpayer.
"Exhibit 6.430.2-2
Guidelines For Developing Critical Job Element (CJE) Performance Plans
(1) Introduction:

(2) The process of performance evaluation guides employees to concentrate on mission related work by making a clear line of sight from their own tasks to the agency’s mission."
"Along the way, the line of sight takes in the short and long term objectives of the work unit and how they tie to agency objectives and the organizational balanced measures."
A core concept is that employees will use their initiative to work towards agency mission if they can see a clear path between their day-to-day tasks and the agency mission.
Every step of the evaluation process is directed at illustrating and supporting that line of sight.
"(3) Two Internal Revenue Service (IRS) programs support this line of sight:

Balanced Measures – tie organizational objectives and actions to the mission

Critical Job Elements (CJEs) – tie individual employee tasks and performance to organizational balance measures

(4) Employees are evaluated by the IRS Performance Management System that supports and aligns employee performance with the IRS mission and balanced measures."
"The IRS Balanced Measurement System is designed to measure organizational performance and focus individuals and the organization on achieving the Service’s overall mission and strategic business goals, rather than achieving a specific target or number."
"The IRS has identified three balanced measures to support its mission and strategic goals:

(5) 1."
"Employee Satisfaction – To create an enabling work environment for employees by providing quality leadership, adequate training and effective support services."
(6) 2.
Customer Satisfaction – To provide accurate and professional services to internal and external customers in a courteous and professional manner.
(7) 3. Business Results (Quality and Quantity) – To generate a productive quantity of work in a quality manner.
"(8) IRS Performance Management System:

(9) A supervisor's assessment of an employee’s performance against that employee's CJEs forms the basis for:

Recognizing and rewarding the employee

Determining employee development needs

Taking performance based actions, if necessary

(10) All new or revised CJE performance plans and aspects must align with the IRS balanced measures."
"All CJE performance plans, (including any new or revised CJE performance aspects) are controlled and approved by the Human Capital Office (HCO), Performance Management and Recognition office."
"(11) CJE performance plans, including CJEs and aspects, are used to evaluate individual employee performance at the IRS for employees who are not managers, management officials, or confidential management/program analysts."
"(12) CJEs:

(13) The CJEs are the critical actions, objectives and results that the IRS expects its employees to accomplish during an appraisal year."
All employees whose performance is evaluated against CJEs have the same five CJEs.
"These CJEs are defined as:

(14) Employee Satisfaction – Employee Contribution– Describes how the employee’s actions contribute to the overall office working conditions."
"The employee supports the workplace climate where ethical behavior is paramount and everyone is treated with honesty, dignity and respect, free from harassment and discrimination."
This CJE is common to all employees.
"This CJE supports the strategic goal of ""Productivity through a Quality Work Environment."""
(15) Customer Satisfaction – Knowledge – Describes how the employee promotes the satisfaction of taxpayers and customers by providing the technical expertise to serve the customers with professional and helpful service.
"Accurate identification and resolution of issues and the correct interpretation of laws, rules, regulations and other information sources are key components of this CJE."
(16) Customer Satisfaction – Application– Describes how the employee promotes the satisfaction of taxpayers and customers through professionally and courteously identifying customers’ needs and/or concerns and providing quality products and services.
Communication to the customer is appropriate for the issue and encourages voluntary compliance.
(17) Business Results – Quality – Describes how the employee promotes the achievement of business results by completing assignments thoroughly and accurately within established guidelines.
The use of proper research and analytical tools and the protection of taxpayer privacy are key components of this CJE.
(18) Business Results – Efficiency – Describes how the employee promotes achievement of business results by completing assignments timely within established guidelines.
The use of proper workload management and time utilization techniques is a key component of this CJE.
"(19) Performance Aspects

(20) Performance aspects are a portion of each CJE that describes the areas under which employees must perform in that CJE, vary with the type of CJE and occupation, and further define the CJEs meaning."
A performance aspect is a group of related tasks and performance standards that identify expectations for performance of those tasks.
The performance aspect clearly tells employees how they are to perform that portion of the CJE and is a key component of the IRS performance appraisal system for employees evaluated by CJEs.
"How well an employee performs in the individual aspects determines the employee’s rating on each CJE, which in turn determines the employee’s overall rating."
(21) Well-written and descriptive performance aspects are the basis of the performance management process.
CJEs describe what an employee must do; performance aspects provide more specificity on what must be done and describe how well the work must be done.
"(22) Guidelines for Developing Performance Plans:

(23) To streamline and simplify the IRS Performance Management System, the goal is to develop one performance plan for all grades in an occupation unless significant differences in duties warrant separate CJE performance aspects."
(24) Developing new or revised performance plans is a five-step process.
"These five steps are:

(25) Step 1: Prepare a list of significant tasks in statement form

(26) Step 2: Align the task statements with the appropriate CJEs

(27) Step 3: Identify performance aspects for each CJE and develop the job analysis

(28) Step 4: Develop individual aspect performance level descriptions

Meets

Exceeds

Fails

(29) Step 5: Develop the final CJE package

(30) Step 1: Prepare a List of Significant Tasks in Statement Form

(31) To ensure all significant tasks are covered by at least one of the CJEs, it is important to conduct a job analysis."
"Supervisors, along with subject matter experts (SMEs), identify major job requirements by highlighting them in the body of the standard position description (SPD) and describing in more detail separately if the description in the SPD is inadequate."
Each job may have hundreds of tasks.
Part of the first step is to generate a list of the tasks.
"After generating the task list, start the process of reducing them to the most significant ones."
"Factors to consider are:

Which duties or tasks are completed most often?"
How much time is spent performing the task?
Does the task carry out a statutory or regulatory requirement?
Is the task mentioned in the SPD?
Does the employee have control over the task?
How difficult is the task?
"If an error is made in performing the task, what are the consequences to the organization?"
Is the duty or task considered a collateral duty or other duty as assigned?
(32) PRODUCT: List of significant tasks of the job in statement form.
"(33) EXAMPLE:

Prepares written correspondence

Answers telephone calls

Processes mail

Reviews and routes correspondence

Maintains time and leave records."
(34) The number of task statements should reflect the complexity of the job.
There may be 20 or more significant task statements.
"(35) Step 2: Align Task Statements with the Appropriate CJEs

(36) All tasks should be grouped under the most appropriate CJE."
This aids in performance aspect development.
"Align all task statements with the most appropriate CJE

Group those task statements which stress the same or very similar tasks

(37) Use the CJE standardized definitions to determine the most appropriate placement of the task."
"(38) Important Note: Since the Employee Satisfaction - Employee Contribution CJE is the same for all positions and cannot be modified, do not align any tasks with this CJE."
"(39) Example of aligning task statements with appropriate CJE:

SIMILAR TASK STATEMENTS

APPROPRIATE CJE

Prepares written correspondence

Customer Satisfaction - Application

Answers telephone calls



Processes mail



Reviews and routes correspondence



Maintains time and leave records



(40) Important Note: While it is possible to associate task statements with more than one CJE, you must select the most appropriate CJE because task statements and performance aspects can align with only one CJE."
"(41) Step 3: Identify Performance Aspects and Develop Job Analysis

(42) Within each CJE, group similar tasks into a 2-3 word task statement."
This task statement becomes part of the performance aspect.
"(43) Performance aspects:

Must apply to performance-related activities not conduct

Must refer to objective, realistic and measurable tasks

Cannot include the use of records of tax enforcement results (ROTERs)

TASK STATEMENTS

2-3 WORD TASK STATEMENT

PERFORMANCE ASPECT

Process Mail

Prepares and processes correspondence

Correspondence

Reviews and routes correspondence





Prepares correspondence





(44) To the extent possible, you should develop at least three aspects per CJE:

An odd number of aspects is required for bargaining unit positions and desirable for non bargaining unit positions."
All aspects must be lettered and numbered.
The HCO has established a limit of five aspects for each CJE to make performance plans compatible with ongoing automation efforts.
"(45) Job Analysis (KSA Identification)

(46) The supervisor and SMEs should also list the Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs) that are required to perform the identified major job requirements and are important in evaluating candidates for merit promotion."
This job analysis should be linked to the new or modified CJE performance aspects.
"See Step 5, Develop the Final CJE Package, for more information about submitting the job analysis and KSAs to the HCO."
(47) A sample of a well-constructed and properly documented job analysis can be found on the Critical Job Elements (CJE) site at https://irssource.web.irs.gov/Lists/CareerOpportunities/DisplaySection.aspx?SectionName=4.
"(48) Step 4: Develop Individual Aspect Performance Level Descriptions

(49) The performance levels are a portion of the performance aspect that clearly tells the employee how the employee is to perform in that aspect."
Performance is measured against specific standards found in the performance levels that describe how well the behavior must be performed.
"Consistently demonstrated superior performance in any of the performance aspects will result in an ""Exceeds"" rating for that aspect."
"(50) Performance aspects tell employees how they are to perform in order to Meet, Exceed, or Fail in that performance aspect."
(51) CJE definitions and the tasks shown in each performance aspect describe what performance employees must demonstrate; performance levels in each aspect describe how well the performance is to be accomplished.
"(52) In accordance with IRS/NTEU contractual agreements, all performance aspects must be written at three levels—Exceeds, Meets, or Fails."
This policy also applies to non bargaining unit positions.
"(53) The three performance levels used to measure CJEs are:

Exceeds - the employee consistently demonstrates the performance."
Meets - the employee generally demonstrates the performance.
Fails - the employee more than occasionally fails to demonstrate the performance.
(54) Applying these levels to the evaluation process allows the rating official to evaluate an employee in a fair and efficient manner.
"(55) The above performance levels are described within three quality ranges:

Consistently - Almost always; the employee performs the task or aspect in a systematically uniform, reliable level of performance and rarely varies from that level."
Generally - As a rule; the employee usually performs the task or aspect at this level in a reasonably inclusive manner.
"Occasionally - Means performance in the range below ""generally."""
"Occasionally is defined as ""now and then; from time to time; infrequently; seldom."""
(56) These terms are used to differentiate work at the three performance levels.
(57) Important Note: Performance aspects should be developed at the Meets level first; Exceeds and Fails levels can be derived from the baseline performance level description for Meets.
"(58) Five factors should be considered when deciding how to write a performance aspect at the Meets level:

Is it observable?"
"- Can it be witnessed; is it concrete and definable

Is it measurable?"
"- Can it be assessed or evaluated; are different performance levels distinguishable

Is it achievable?"
"- Is it possible to accomplish; do no barriers exist

Is it reasonable?"
"- Does employee have the necessary skills, knowledge, and ability to complete the assignment; can it be accomplished within a specific time frame

Is it understandable?"
"- Is what is being measured clear; is when the performance will be measured clear; is how the performance will be measured clear

(59) Important Note: Avoid these when developing performance at the Meets level:

Absolute Standards - The Meets performance level cannot be written in absolute terms (for example, 100 % accuracy)."
"Meets performance levels written without the opportunity for errors are called absolute standards and are prohibited by OPM, the Merit System Protection Board, and the Federal courts unless a single failure to perform would result in loss of life, injury, breach of national security, or great monetary loss

Backward Standards - Do not describe work that does not get done instead of describing what the employee needs to accomplish."
"Ask yourself the following question when developing the Meets performance level: Does the performance level express the work that you expect to see for the employee to be successful or does it describe negative performance

(60) Product:

(61) Rewrite the 2-3 word task statements into more complete sentences to help define the action the employee performs and the expected results of the action."
Each task statement begins with an action verb that is as specific as possible.
"(62) Task statements include numbers or phrases that describe how well, how many, or how soon a task should be accomplished:

Be specific and avoid vague terminology such as ""be familiar with,"" ""deals with,"" and ""be responsible for""

The Meets level allows room for outstanding accomplishment (Exceeds)."
"The Meets level should not be written at such a high level that there is no room to define an Exceeds level

(63) Example:

(64) Generally prepares and processes (action verbs) correspondence within established timeframes to ensure prompt response to customers (expected result)."
(65) Performance aspects for the Exceeds and Fails levels are developed only after the performance aspects for the Meets level have been completed.
(66) Performance aspects measure how well the work is being performed.
"You may consider the following factors in defining levels of performance for Exceeds and Fails:

Quality - How well it is done

Quantity - Time utilization

Timeliness - Adherence to specified time frame

Manner - The way the work is done or style

Method - Procedures, policies, or technical requirements

Cost - Dollars and staff requirements

(67) The Exceeds and Fails levels should consider the following five factors:

The performance aspects should be reasonable and measurable

Each consecutive level of the aspect should assume achievement at the next lower level with a logical connection between levels

The Exceeds level should be beyond the performance of the majority of employees, but attainable by some

The Exceeds level should show meeting as well as going beyond the Meets level, often describing productivity improvement

Each item in the Meets level must be reflected in the Fails level

(68) EXAMPLE:

(69) Exceeds: Consistently prepares and processes correspondence within established timeframes to ensure prompt response to customers."
(70) Meets: Generally prepares and processes correspondence within established timeframes to ensure prompt response to customers.
"(71) Fails: More than occasionally fails to prepare and process correspondence within established timeframes, which does not ensure prompt response to customers."
"(72) Heightened Level of Performance

(73) Some performance aspects found in the CJEs require a heightened level of performance because of their sensitivity or importance to the IRS."
"These special aspects include such areas as statute determination, security, disclosure, privacy, and timekeeping for secretaries and related administrative positions."
"(74) Heightened levels of performance can be defined in the following terms:

Always - Without exception; describes the Exceeds level of performance only for those aspects requiring a heightened level of performance."
Except in very rare circumstances - Describes the Meets level of performance only for those aspects requiring a heightened level of performance.
"In determining the existence of ""very rare circumstances,"" the supervisor considers mitigating and aggravating factors that may include, but are not limited to, the complexity of the issue and the gravity of the occurrence."
Fails to…in the absence of very rare circumstances - Describes the Fails level when there is a heightened level of performance required at the Meets level.
"Any failure that does not result from ""very rare circumstances"" will result in a Fails rating."
"(75) The following describes the heightened performance levels:

Exceeds: The employee always demonstrates that behavior."
"Meets: The employee, except in very rare circumstances demonstrates the behavior."
Fails: The employee fails to demonstrate the behavior in the absence of very rare circumstances.
"(76) Step 5: Develop the Final CJE Package

(77) Performance aspects must be developed for each CJE at each level of performance and recorded in the template provided later in this exhibit."
(78) The Employee Satisfaction - Employee Contribution CJE will always remain the same for all positions.
"(79) While the CJEs and their definitions will always remain the same, the number, title, and content of the performance aspects will vary by performance plan."
"(80) Completed CJE Performance Plan Packages

(81) Divisions and functions must ensure that the above steps are followed when new performance plans are developed or existing performance plans are modified."
A template for use in developing new or modified performance plans is provided in this exhibit.
"(82) Since performance plans and CJE aspects are intended to be as cross-functional as possible, divisions and functions should coordinate development of a new or revised performance plan with other divisions or functions that may use that performance plan."
"(83) Documenting the Job Analysis

(84) Divisions and functions must perform a complete job analysis when creating or modifying performance plans."
"This job analysis includes the following documentation:

A copy of the applicable SPD(s)

Major job requirements (should be highlighted in the body of the SPD and described in more detail on a separate sheet if the description in the SPD is inadequate)

A list of KSAs that are required to perform the identified major job requirements and are important in evaluating candidates

An explanation of the linkage of the listed KSAs to the new or modified CJE performance aspects

A statement indicating that all of the CJE performance plans for the occupation were reviewed and a new performance plan is required for this position

The name, title, pay plan/series/grade, signature, and signature date for SMEs responsible for job analysis validity (two or more recommended)

The name, signature, and signature date of the reviewing human resources specialist

(85) Divisions and functions must submit new or revised performance plans to the HCO, Performance Management and Recognition office, for review and approval."
"(86) After approval, the HCO will submit the new or revised performance plans covering bargaining unit employees to the National Headquarters, NTEU, as required by the National Agreement Document 11678."
NTEU will be afforded an opportunity to bargain impact and implementation before the new or revised performance plans for bargaining unit employees are put into effect.
"(87) After performance plans are approved and NTEU is afforded an opportunity to comment on plans covering bargaining unit employees, the completed performance plans will be forwarded to the Multimedia Division for publication in its products catalog."

"(6) For paybanded managers, the date that the performance appraisal will be shared with the employee may be extended because of the Performance Review Board (PRB) appraisal review process."
This PRB review process will normally require additional time for the processing of paybanded performance appraisals and awards determinations.
It is the responsibility of the divisions and functions to specify their appraisal processing timeframes for paybanded positions.

6.430.3.1 (12-08-2017)
Program Scope and Objectives
This IRM provides policy and guidance on the Performance Management Program for Evaluating Managers, Management Officials, and Confidential Management/Program Analysts."
"Purpose: It provides the legal basis and manner in which the performance of managers, management officials, and confidential management/program analysts are evaluated."
"Audience: All supervisors, managers, management officials, human resources specialists, and labor relations specialists."
"Policy Owner: Associate Director, Performance Management Branch."
"Program Owner: Associate Director, Performance Management Branch."
Primary Stakeholders: Business Units Servicewide.
"6.430.3.2 (01-01-2007)
Overview and Coverage
This section describes the manner in which managers and management officials are evaluated."
"The requirements and procedures of this section also apply to employees whose positions are classified as management/program analysts, GS-343, and who are officially designated as confidential employees."
Note: A confidential employee is defined by 5 U.S.C.
"7103(a)(13), as ""an employee who acts in a confidential capacity with respect to an individual who formulates or effectuates management policies in the field of labor-management relations."""
"The performance of employees assigned supervisory codes 2 (supervisor or manager), 4 (supervisor-CSRA), 5 (management official), and in some instances supervisory code 7 (i.e., team leaders who lead management officials) are evaluated against critical performance expectations."
"In addition, certain non-bargaining unit management/program analysts, GS-343, who are officially classified as confidential and have supervisory codes 7 or 8 are also covered by critical performance expectations."
The supervisory code is found on the employees standard position description (SPD) and controls the appropriate performance plan.
"Supervisors should review IRM 6.430.1, Introduction to Performance Management, for background information before proceeding with this section."
It is the supervisor's responsibility to ensure that he or she administers the IRS Performance Management Program effectively and efficiently as it pertains to his or her employees.
"Additionally, supervisors must keep current on performance management policies and processes through training courses and on-line resources."
"For more information, see the performance management website http://hco.web.irs.gov/perfmgmt/index.html."
"6.430.3.3 (01-01-2007)
Step 1: Planning Critical Performance Expectations
During this step, the supervisor and the employee work closely together to plan and establish distinct commitments or objectives to be accomplished during the specified appraisal period and discuss how they relate to the responsibilities."
Effective planning of performance expectations helps ensure the alignment of individual performance with the business goals and objectives of the organization.
"6.430.3.3.1 (10-28-2011)
Starting the Performance Appraisal Cycle
Except in rare circumstances such as when the employee is on extended sick leave, the supervisor must meet with the employee within the first 30 days of the beginning of an employee's appraisal period, or when the employee is assigned to a new position for at least 60 days (e.g., temporary promotions, details), to review responsibilities and establish commitments or objectives and discuss the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"The performance appraisal cycle for managers, management officials, and confidential management/program analysts is based on the fiscal year and normally begins October 1."
"The supervisor reviews the employee's assigned SPD, verifying that it accurately reflects the assigned duties."
"If it does not, the supervisor contacts the Human Capital Office (HCO) for assistance in identifying the appropriate SPD or developing a new one."
"6.430.3.3.2 (06-12-2009)
Critical Performance Expectations
Managers, management officials, and confidential management/program analysts are rated against critical performance expectations."
"Critical performance expectations consist of three components:
Retention Standard for the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers."
Responsibilities.
Commitments or Objectives.
"6.430.3.3.2.1 (10-28-2011)
Retention Standard for the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, (RRA98) 1204, requires all IRS employees to be evaluated on the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
This requirement has been incorporated into a Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers that is the same for all employees.
"For more information on the requirements of the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers, see IRM 6.430.3.2.5 and IRM Exhibit 6.430.2-1, Performance Management Program for Evaluating BU & NBU Employees Assigned to CJEs."
"6.430.3.3.2.2 (01-01-2007)
Responsibilities
Responsibilities are common to all managers, management officials, and confidential management/program analysts, and are aligned with the IRS Balanced Measurement System."
Responsibilities guide the actions an employee commits to undertake during the performance appraisal period and describe how the employee performs his or her job.
"Responsibilities for managers are:
Leadership."
Employee Satisfaction.
Customer Satisfaction.
Business Results.
Equal Employment Opportunity.
"Responsibilities for management officials are:
Program Leadership."
Employee Satisfaction.
Customer Satisfaction.
Business Results.
Professional Expertise.
"Responsibilities for confidential management/program analysts are:
Analysis and Evaluation."
Employee Satisfaction.
Customer Satisfaction.
Business Results.
Communications.
"6.430.3.3.2.3 (01-01-2007)
Commitments
Commitments are derived from the Strategic Business Plans and establish a linkage between organizational performance and individual performance."
Commitments are specific for each employee.
Each commitment is a distinct action with identified and measurable results to be achieved during the performance appraisal period.
"6.430.3.3.2.4 (10-28-2011)
Objectives
Management/Program Analysts, GS-343, designated as non-bargaining unit because of the confidential exclusion have objectives in lieu of commitments."
"Objectives are a limited number of critical actions, goals, and/or results the confidential management/program analyst will be expected to accomplish during the appraisal year."
"These objectives should be derived from, and directly contribute to, the program priorities and goals established by the organizations annual business or operations plan."
Objectives are similar to commitments for managers and management officials and are a key component of these employees' critical performance expectations.
"6.430.3.3.3 (01-01-2007)
Reviewing Responsibilities
Both the supervisor and the employee should review the responsibilities found in Part I, Section A, of the appropriate performance agreement to ensure mutual understanding of how each responsibility applies to the employees expected performance during the upcoming performance appraisal period."
"6.430.3.3.4 (10-28-2011)
Establishing Commitments or Objectives
Commitments and objectives enable managers, management officials, and confidential management/program analysts to develop action items that will, in turn, carry out the Service's day-to-day operations, linking their activities to the IRS' goals and objectives."
"Each commitment or objective should relate to, and support, one or more of the responsibilities listed in the performance agreement."
The supervisor should share his or her commitments with the employee prior to the employee's commitments or objectives being developed.
The supervisor discusses how the employees commitments or objectives should link to the organizational workplans and balanced measures.
"Note: For additional information, see IRM 1.5.1, Managing Statistics in a Balanced Measurement System - The IRS Balanced Measurement System."
"The supervisor should review documents such as organizational program plans, business plans, site-specific issues/priorities, Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action plans, and balanced measures data when preparing to discuss with the employee what needs to be included in his or her commitments or objectives."
The supervisor and employee should identify the most important areas on which to focus.
"The supervisor and the employee jointly develop the employee's commitments or objectives, with the reviewing official having the final authority for approval of the performance agreement."
"6.430.3.3.4.1 (10-28-2011)
Guidelines for Developing Well Constructed Commitments or Objectives
Supervisors and employees should think of commitments and objectives as the ""What"" and responsibilities as the ""How."""
"Generally, a limited number of commitments or objectives should be established to represent challenges for the employee."
Each commitment or objective should be results oriented.
"When developing the commitments or objectives, discussions should include the means of accomplishing the commitments or objectives, such as: specific timing, expected performance levels, methods of measurement, and level of organizational support (funding, staff, and training) needed."
"The following should be considered when writing commitments or objectives:
State specifically what is to be accomplished, not general tasks, duties, or responsibilities of an ongoing job."
Describe challenging but realistic actions the employee can accomplish.
"Maintain a ""line of sight"" to the goals of the Service."
"Include a clear timeframe for accomplishment, some commitments or objectives may take less than one year to accomplish and others may take longer."
"If the timeframe is longer than one year, interim milestones should be identified in the performance agreement."
Verify they are achievable and can be monitored.
Focus on describing the outcomes or results that will exist when the commitment or objective has been successfully achieved.
Outline required organizational resources or support.
"Consider available resources from the employee's assigned organization, as well as other parts of the IRS."
"Keep in mind how the commitments or objectives will be measured, how the employee will demonstrate achievement."
For managers only: ensure the commitments or objectives are specific enough so that direct reports can understand them.
Focus on individual actions that support organizational priorities.
"Begin each commitment or objective with the phrase ""I will"" to frame what the employee will do rather than what the organization will achieve."
"When drafting commitments and objectives, use an explanatory conjunctive phrase such as ""so that"" , ""in order to"" or ""to ensure that"" to tie each commitment or objective to an expected result or outcome."
Consider what data sources will be used to monitor progress in meeting commitments or objectives.
"Note: For more information on writing commitments, see Writing Performance Commitments, A Reference Guide for Managers and Management Officials at http://hco.web.irs.gov/perfmgmt/perfplan/mgmtoffic/writecommitments.html and ELMS self-instructional Writing Commitments for Managers and Management Officials."
"6.430.3.3.4.2 (06-12-2009)
Documenting Commitments or Objectives
After the supervisor and the employee discuss and agree on commitments or objectives, they are recorded under Part I, Section B of the appropriate performance agreement form."
The supervisor and the reviewing official make the final determination whether the commitment or objective should be included in the performance agreement if the supervisor and the employee cannot agree on the commitments or objectives.
It is important to document any changes in the commitments or objectives throughout the performance appraisal period.
"6.430.3.3.4.3 (10-28-2011)
Getting Behind the Numbers
Commitments or objectives should be qualitative in nature, but can and should be guided by the organization's quantitative performance measures."
The reason for this restriction is fundamental to the intent of the balanced measurement approach and critical to changing behaviors.
"If individuals are held accountable solely for achieving specific numerical targets, the natural response is to focus attention on the numbers and not on the actions."
"""Getting behind the numbers"" is a seven-step problem-solving process, as shown in Figure 6.430.3-1."
"Throughout this process, numbers are only a starting point."
"The objective is to identify individual commitments, objectives, or actions to improve organizational performance."
"IRM 1.5.2, Managing Statistics in a Balanced Measurement System - Section 1204 Certification and Independent Review Processes, provides more detail on how to use numbers appropriately in evaluating organizational and individual performance and the prohibition in using Records of Tax Enforcement Results (ROTERs) in evaluating the performance of managers, management officials, and confidential management/program analysts."
"In evaluating the performance of a manager, management official, or confidential management/program analyst, the numerical results achieved with any of the IRS Balanced Measures (Employee Satisfaction, Customer Satisfaction, and Business Results) will never equate directly to a particular rating."
"Rather, an evaluation should focus on the actions that were taken (commitments or objectives) against the objectives and the results achieved to improve performance in each responsibility."
The numerical results are helpful only for making an initial assessment of the impact those actions had on the Responsibilities.

Although employee engagement issues related to Leadership, Employee Satisfaction, Business Results, and Equal Employment Opportunity are proper areas that should be considered in evaluating managerial performance, manager performance commitments should be written in terms of the actions the manager can take to influence the employee survey numerical score."
"Since the employee survey numerical scores do not reflect the specific actions the manager took to improve the issue affecting the workgroup performance, managerial performance commitments should not be written in terms of improving the quantitative score or the participation percentage."
The employee survey numerical score should only be considered an indicator pointing to areas which might need further consideration and may be used to determine the appropriate workgroup issues for development of managerial commitments.
"Commitments based on organizational performance objectives, such as the employee survey, should focus primarily on what actions the manager will take to improve the workgroup environment and bringing resolution to the issue where possible, since the survey scores may change for many reasons which are outside of the managers ability to control."
"6.430.3.3.5 (06-12-2009)
Discussing the Retention Standard for the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers
The supervisor must discuss with the employee behaviors that will allow the employee to meet the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers, circumstances that may result in a determination that the employee does not meet the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers, and the potential impact of not meeting the Retention Standard."
"IRM Exhibit 6.430.2-1, Performance Management Program for Evaluating BU & NBU Employees Assigned to CJEs provides examples of Retention Standard behavior that may result in a ""Met"" or ""Not Met"" rating."
"Discussions concerning the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers may include:
An explanation of the requirements of the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers in relationship to the employees job expectations."
The potential impacts of not meeting the standard.
"Avoidance of use of the words ""deliberately"" or ""intentionally"" in describing behavior that does not meet the standard."
"An explanation of why infrequent lapses that are inadvertent or unavoidable will not result in a ""Not Met"" rating."
"An explanation of why a ""Met"" or ""Not Applicable"" rating will have no effect on the summary evaluation rating, ranking in merit promotion actions, or entitlement to performance awards."
"An explanation of why a ""Not Met"" rating for the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers will result in a ""Not Met"" summary evaluation rating."
"A ""Not Met"" summary evaluation rating makes the employee ineligible for a performance award, within-grade increase (WIGI), career ladder promotion, competition for promotion, or satisfactory completion of a probationary period, and may result in the employees removal from the position and/or the IRS."
"A ""Not Met"" overall rating will also adversely affect an employees retention standing in a reduction in force (RIF)."
"Note: See IRM Exhibit 6.430.2-1, Performance Management Program for Evaluating BU & NBU Employees Assigned to CJEs and Retention Standard Guidance at http://hco.web.irs.gov/perfmgmt/evaluation/evalperf/nonmgrpolicy.html for additional information on the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"6.430.3.3.6 (12-08-2017)
National Security Critical Element
Executive Order 12958, Classified National Security Information, requires that all managers and management officials whose duties significantly involve the creation or handling of classified information and who handle national security information on a regular basis must have a critical element in their annual performance agreement dealing with this activity."
Holding a national security clearance does not automatically require that the National Security Critical Element be included in the performance plan.
"The critical element is only applicable for managers and management officials who have regular, hands-on-work that requires classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying national security information."
Each manager must determine on a case-by-case basis if their employees should be covered by this critical element.
"The U.S. Department of the Treasury Classified National Security Information Critical Element form should be added as a separate attachment to the performance agreements of affected managers, supervisors, and management officials."
"Because this element affects a limited number of employees, it has not been incorporated into Form 12450-A, Manager Performance Agreement, or Form 12450-B, Management Official Performance Agreement."
The element should be attached to the performance agreement as long as the employee continues to perform work that meets the requirements of the Executive Order.
"Upon deciding to incorporate the element into the performance agreement of a manager, supervisor, or management official, the manager must discuss the critical element with the employee and have the manager or management official acknowledge receipt via signature on the form."
"Information about the Classified National Security Information Critical Element, a Decision Table for Implementation of the National Security Information Critical Job Element (For Managers, Supervisors, and Management Officials), and a link to the Classified National Security Information Critical Element for Evaluating Managers, Supervisors, and Management Officials form can be found under the “Related Links” heading on the Managers Performance Plan page of the HCO Performance Management website at: http://hco.web.irs.gov/perfmgmt/perfplan/mgrperfplan/index.html."
"6.430.3.3.7 (12-08-2017)
Documenting the Performance Agreement
The rating official, reviewing official, and employee sign and date the performance agreement to acknowledge that they have discussed the critical performance expectations."
This discussion should occur within 30 days of the beginning of the appraisal period.
"The performance agreements for employees covered by the requirements of this section are:
Managers - Form 12450-A, Manager Performance Agreement."
"Management Officials - Form 12450-B, Management Official Performance Agreement."
"Confidential Management/Program Analysts (GS-343) - Form 12450-D, Management/Program Analyst Performance Agreement (Positions Designated as Confidential Only)."
"Following the discussion, the supervisor should give a copy of the performance agreement to the employee and file the original in the Employee Performance File (EPF)."
"For more information on the EPF, see IRM 6.430.3.3.3 and the Employee Performance File document at: https://portal.ds.irsnet.gov/sites/ERCDocs/2002/HCO/CompLvBr/EPFGuideforMgrs.pdf."
The employee and supervisor should use the performance agreement and the critical performance expectations to monitor accomplishments or other significant events as they occur.
"6.430.3.4 (01-01-2007)
Step 2: Monitoring Progress
During this step the supervisor should continuously monitor progress against critical performance expectations, identify accomplishments and deficiencies, and initiate corrective actions when necessary."
"6.430.3.4.1 (12-08-2017)
Monitoring Commitments or Objectives
After the supervisor and employee have reached agreement on a set of commitments or objectives, the supervisor should monitor the employee's progress in meeting the responsibilities and achieving the commitments or objectives throughout the appraisal period."
"At a minimum, the supervisor must conduct a mandatory mid-year progress review."
"This progress review generally occurs in April and should include a discussion of the employees progress in meeting expectations (Responsibilities, Commitments or Objectives, and Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers)."
"This mandatory mid-year progress review must be documented on the Manager, Management Official, or Confidential Management/Program Analyst Performance Agreement."
The supervisor should also document any other progress reviews held and provide a copy to the employee.
Documented observations throughout the performance appraisal period serve as an aid in completing the mandatory mid-year progress review and the annual evaluation.
"The supervisor should identify the actions taken to accomplish commitments or objectives, and responsibilities."
The supervisor should focus on the employees performance as it relates to the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers and progress toward achieving commitments or objectives.
"If necessary, the supervisor should identify improvement opportunities."
"At any point during the performance cycle, the supervisor and the employee can review and revise commitments or objectives to reflect changes in the priorities of the Service."
"Changes may be needed for reasons such as: the expectations of commitments or objectives changed; or the Service's mission, strategic business goals, or business plans changed; or the level of available support (e.g., staff, dollars, training) decreased or increased."
Changes to commitments or objectives must be made at least 60 days before the end of the performance appraisal period to avoid having to extend the appraisal period.
The supervisor may NOT use Records of Tax Enforcement Results (ROTERs) in monitoring progress against critical performance expectations.
The ROTERs do not convey whether an individual performed well under his or her critical performance expectations.
"For additional information on ROTERs, see IRM 1.5.2, Managing Statistics in a Balanced Measurement System - Section 1204, Certification and Independent Review Processes."
Progress reviews including mid-year reviews may not be disputed.
Assessments of performance at the time of a progress review may differ from the annual summary evaluation.
Disputes filed before the end of the appraisal period would be premature.
"However, employees may submit documentation to the supervisor regarding matters of concern on the progress review."
"The following includes actions the supervisor should take to monitor progress against critical performance expectations:
Record observations as they occur, recalling past behavior is often difficult."
"Focus on specific actions the employee took to accomplish commitments or objectives, and how responsibilities were demonstrated; avoid evaluating personality traits."
"Cite performance or results, not conduct or general impressions."
Document observations in sufficient detail to be understood by another supervisor.
Document performance for all employees consistently.
Avoid comparing one employee to another.
Maintain performance data in the employees EPF.
All documents used in formulating an evaluation must be shared with the employee prior to placing it in his or her EPF.
"Note: For additional information on EPFs, see IRM 6.430.3.3.3 and the Employee Performance File document at: https://portal.ds.irsnet.gov/sites/ERCDocs/2002/HCO/CompLvBr/EPFGuideforMgrs.pdf
."
"6.430.3.4.2 (10-28-2011)
Minimally Satisfactory and Not Met Performance
If at any time during the appraisal period an employee's performance in one or more critical performance expectations (Responsibilities, Commitments or Objectives, or the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers) falls below the ""Met"" level, the manager must provide assistance."
"The supervisor must consult with their servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office regarding any performance rating of ""Not Met"" or ""Minimally Satisfactory"" to ensure that all parties understand the implications of failing to improve."
"Employees who do not meet the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers, Commitments or Objectives and/or Responsibilities should be counseled as early as possible in the appraisal period."
"Failure to improve or to sustain a ""Met"" rating could impact an employee's ability to remain in his or her position."
"Failure to improve or to sustain a ""Met"" rating could also impact an employee's salary review and cause the employee to be ineligible for a pay increase under an IRS Payband System."
"Before a supervisor begins the formal process of taking a performance-based action, the supervisor needs to be aware that he or she has certain options."
"The law provides for two different processes for taking performance-based actions:
If a performance-based action is taken under 5 CFR Part 432, a formal opportunity to improve is required."
"If a performance-based action is taken under the adverse action procedures of 5 CFR Part 752, an opportunity period is not required."
"Note: Regardless of the process used, the supervisor must contact the servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office for assistance."
"""Not Met"" ratings must be reviewed and approved by an official higher than the rating official."
"When an employee's performance fails to meet established performance expectations at an acceptable level in one or more critical performance expectations (i.e., Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers, Commitments or Objectives and/or Responsibilities), the supervisor must notify the employee in writing."
"This notice must advise the employee of the following:
That his or her performance is unacceptable."
Which critical performance expectation(s) are not being performed in an acceptable manner.
"What is required to perform at the rating level of ""Met"" or above."
Any assistance that will be provided to the employee.
What the reasonable period to demonstrate acceptable performance will be.
"Failure to perform at an acceptable performance level may result in removal, reduction in grade, withholding of a WIGI, denial of a performance-based increase, or reassignment depending upon the performance factors."
Note: Supervisors must contact their servicing Labor Relations/ Employee Relations Office for assistance in dealing with an employees failure of a critical performance expectation.
"If the employee demonstrates acceptable performance during the opportunity period, the rating official retains the notice of unacceptable performance in the EPF for one year from the date the opportunity period became effective."
"In accordance with 5 U.S.C 4303(d) if, because of performance improvement by the employee during the notice period, the employee is not reduced in grade or removed, and the employee's performance continues to be acceptable for one year from the date of the advance written notice, any entry or other notation of the unacceptable performance for which the action was proposed must be removed from any record, manual and automated, relating to the employee."
The rating official is responsible for removing and destroying such records from the EPF and for initiating removal from the Service's automated personnel records.
"Saving Provision - Any administrative action initiated (e.g., an action taken against ""Not Met"" employees under 5 U.S.C 4303) must continue to be processed consistent with the procedures and requirements of the program in effect when the action was initiated."
"A rating of ""Minimally Satisfactory"" or ""Not Met"" will also lead to the employee's ineligibility to receive a within-grade increase, career ladder promotion, or to complete his or her probationary period."
"A rating of ""Minimally Satisfactory"" or ""Not Met"" will also lead to the employee's ineligibility to receive a basic pay increase under an IRS Payband System."
"Note: See IRM 6.531.1.2, Pay Under the General Schedule."
"6.430.3.4.3 (12-08-2017)
Employee Performance File (EPF)
The EPF consists of all performance ratings and other performance-related records maintained on an IRS employee in accordance with 5 CFR 293, Subpart D.
Note: For additional information, see the Employee Performance File document at: Employee Performance File document at: https://portal.ds.irsnet.gov/sites/ERCDocs/2002/HCO/CompLvBr/EPFGuideforMgrs.pdf
."
Management is responsible for creating records concerning employee performance and maintaining them in accordance with the Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act regulations.
"At a minimum, the EPF should contain forms and documents which:
Record and support the performance appraisal and individual performance plans."
Are used by the supervisor to recommend a personnel action affecting an employee when the basis for the action is performance related.
Are furnished in support of recommended actions and the agency's final decision on the matter.
"Note: Other types of documents and forms may include Individual Development Plans (IDPs), recommendations for training that are performance-related, and copies of supervisory counseling session records resulting in performance-based personnel actions."
"The following documents must be maintained for four years:
The Performance Agreement (Forms 12450-A,12450-B, or 12450-D appropriate for the employee's position)."
Progress review(s) documentation.
Employee self-assessments.
"Documented workload reviews, case file reviews, and job visitations."
Any other documentation that supports the performance rating.
"The supervisor must keep performance records in the EPF as long as necessary, if needed in connection with a grievance, appeal or judicial proceeding."
"For employees who are permanently changing positions within the IRS, the supervisor will ensure the employee's entire EPF is forwarded to the gaining supervisor."
"For employees who are accepting outside employment and leaving the IRS, who are accepting employment with another government agency, or who are resigning or retiring from the IRS, the supervisor must remove all of the ratings of record completed within the last four years from the separating employees EPF, attach these ratings of record to Transmittal Form 3210, and forward the package to the following address:
Internal Revenue Service - OPF Consolidation Site
440 Space Center Drive
Lee's Summit, MO 64064

The National Archives and Records Administration staff will ensure the ratings of record are filed in the Official Personnel Folder (OPF) before being sent to the Federal Records Center if the employee resigns or to the gaining agency if the employee transfers."
"Supervisors must destroy any remaining performance related documents unless such records are needed in connection with a grievance, appeal, or judicial proceeding."
"6.430.3.5 (06-12-2009)
Step 3: Evaluating Performance
During this step the supervisor completes the employee's performance appraisal and conducts a performance appraisal meeting with the employee."
"6.430.3.5.1 (06-12-2009)
The Annual Performance Appraisal Process
All employees who have served the minimum appraisal period of 60 calendar days are entitled to an annual performance appraisal that becomes the rating of record."
"Permanent supervisors, complete the annual performance appraisals for employees under their authority."
"Employees who are temporarily promoted or detailed to a supervisory position have the authority to complete the annual performance appraisals for employees under their supervision, as long as the employees meet the requirements for an annual performance appraisal."
There is no minimum period of time required for this authority.
"The employees performance must have been observed a minimum of 60 days in the appraisal period by any supervisor who was responsible for assigning, reviewing, and evaluating the employee's work."
"However, it is not necessary for the employee's current supervisor to have observed the employees performance under a signed performance plan for 60 days or more."
"The supervisor should consider the following when evaluating performance to complete an annual appraisal:
Position description."
Performance Agreement.
Documents in the employees EPF.
Mid-year and other progress reviews.
"Employee's written documents (management briefings, memos) and/or presentations given
Employee's self-assessment."
"Feedback from coworkers, taxpayers, and other customers."
Team assignments and contributions to the work group.
Special achievements.
"Note: For more information on the various reasons for performance appraisals, see IRM 6.430.2, Exhibit 6.430.2-3."
"6.430.3.5.1.1 (10-28-2011)
Appraisal Period
Employees covered by performance agreements are evaluated in accordance with appraisal periods based on the fiscal year."
"In general, the annual rating of record covers the full fiscal year regardless of permanent promotions, temporary promotions, details, projects, or task forces."
"If the employee has not been observed for 60 days on his or her performance plan at the time the employee's annual rating is due, the supervisor must:
Ensure that a performance agreement has been issued."
Ensure that the employee has signed the performance agreement.
Postpone any rating until the employees performance has been observed for a minimum of 60 days.
Use the employees existing rating of record as the current rating of record until the new performance appraisal is prepared.
"If the employee has no performance during the fiscal year on a signed performance agreement and the fiscal year has ended, the employee is considered ""Not Ratable"" for that fiscal year."
"See IRM 6.430.3.5.4 for more information on ""Not Ratable"" determinations."
"A new performance agreement is not required for an employee returning to his or her permanent position following a temporary personnel action, if the employee is returning during the same appraisal year."
"In this case, the supervisor for the employee's permanent position may reinstate the performance agreement previously in effect, rather than completing a new performance agreement."
The time previously accrued under that performance agreement would count toward the 60 day period for rating eligibility.
"6.430.3.5.1.2 (10-28-2011)
Performance Appraisal Due Dates
The supervisor must complete the employee annual appraisal within the scheduled time limits shown in Exhibit 6.430.2-4, provided the employee has been observed for 60 days or more against his or her signed performance plan during the appraisal period."
Departure appraisals are required for temporary assignments of 60 days or more during the appraisal period.
These appraisals should be completed within 30 days after the employee completes the temporary assignment and should be forwarded to the supervisor responsible for assigning the rating of record.
"Note: For more information concerning departure appraisals, see the discussion on departure appraisals in IRM 6.430.3.5.1, IRM 6.430.5, and Exhibit 6.430.2-3."
"6.430.3.5.1.3 (10-28-2011)
Extension of the Appraisal Period
When an annual rating of record cannot be prepared at the specified time, the appraisal period shall be extended for the minimum period to meet the conditions necessary to complete a rating of record."
"To extend the appraisal period, the employee must be in work status on the appraisal period ending date and have observed performance under a signed performance agreement during the fiscal year."
The supervisor must decide to extend the employee's appraisal period on or before the employee's appraisal period ending date.
"If the employee has no performance under a signed performance agreement during the fiscal year and the appraisal period has ended, the employee is ""Not Ratable"" ."
"See IRM 6.430.3.5.4 for more information on ""Not Ratable"" determinations."
The rating of record shall be prepared in accordance with the instructions in this section.
"Examples of extension situations include, but are not limited :
To meet the 60 day minimum performance appraisal period."
"However, the supervisor should not extend the appraisal period of a newly-hired employee solely to provide the employee with a rating of record."
"In that event, the employee is ""Not Ratable"" for the appraisal period."
"Note: For more information on ""Not Ratable"" determinations, see IRM 6.430.3.5.4."
To provide a new supervisor an opportunity to observe an employee's performance against current requirements when information concerning the employee's past performance is not available.
"To appraise an employee whose overall performance has been less than acceptable due to personal circumstances (e.g., extended illness or other circumstances), and there is evidence of improvement in the employee's performance."
To provide an employee who has been notified of his or her failure to meet one or more of the critical performance expectations an opportunity to improve performance.
"An extension of the appraisal period will not affect the next appraisal ""period covered"" ending date; however, it shortens the next ""period covered"" (specifically, the ""from"" date) by the length of the extension."
"When the appraisal period is extended, the supervisor shall immediately inform the employee and the reviewing official."
Supervisors should enter the employee's annual appraisal into the Service's automated performance appraisal system after the extended appraisal period is completed and the rating of record is assigned.
"6.430.3.5.1.4 (10-28-2011)
Dates on the Performance Appraisal Form
The supervisor should accurately annotate the appraisal period on the appraisal form."
"The date the annual appraisal period ends will normally be the ""to"" date under period covered on the performance agreement form."
The entire appraisal period including any extensions necessary should be indicated under the period covered.
"If an employee's departure from a permanent position is within 60 days from the date the appraisal period ends, the ""to"" date should reflect the actual departure date since that date reflects the date the employee actually departed his or her position."
"6.430.3.5.2 (10-28-2011)
Requesting the Self-Assessment
Self-assessments are narrative descriptions or lists of accomplishments that the employee develops to describe his or her realization of goals, objectives, achievements, and significant accomplishments or shortfalls during a specified appraisal period."
"An effective self-assessment describes the specific actions taken by the employee to accomplish work requirements identified by responsibilities, commitments or objectives, and the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"As the end of the performance appraisal period approaches, the supervisor should request that the employee prepare a written summary of his or her performance not to exceed two pages."
"The supervisor should explain that the self-assessment becomes a part of the manager's, management official's, or confidential management/program analyst's performance agreement."
Providing a self-assessment contributes to the preparation of an accurate summary evaluation.
"6.430.3.5.2.1 (06-12-2009)
Preparing the Self-Assessment
In preparing the self-assessment, the employee should:
Review the duties and responsibilities of the position and the Responsibilities and Commitments/Objectives identified in the performance agreement for the performance period."
"Identify all significant results achieved that were reflected in the agreement especially those that contribute to the overall success of the IRS mission, strategic business goals, and business plans."
"Identify all significant results achieved that were not reflected in the agreement such as contributions to the workgroup, special achievements, and team assignments."
Review responsibilities required for success in the position and identify areas in which he/she excels or needs improvement.
The self-assessment should be based on self-analysis.
Recognition of performance by customers and peers may be included as well.
"Note: For more information on writing self-assessments, see Writing Self-Assessments Managers and Management Officials at http://hco.web.irs.gov/pdf/writingselfassmnts.pdf ."
"6.430.3.5.2.2 (10-28-2011)
Using Records of Tax Enforcement Results (ROTERs) in Self-Assessments
Although using ROTERs in self-assessments does not violate the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, (RRA98) 1204 or the implementing regulations, to dispel even the appearance of impropriety, employees should not be permitted to use ROTERs in self-assessments."
It is a violation if a ranking official or panel uses ROTER information in the ranking process or if a supervisor uses the information when evaluating employees' performance.
"If a manager, management official, or confidential management/program analyst submits a self-assessment with ROTERs, it should be returned to the employee for removal of the ROTERs."
"Note: For additional information on ROTERs, see IRM 1.5.2, Managing Statistics in a Balanced Measurement System - Section 1204 Certification and Independent Review Processes."
"6.430.3.5.3 (10-28-2011)
Completing the Summary Narrative
This narrative is limited to the space on the form and should outline the key accomplishments for each commitment or objective and relate accomplishments to performance in the responsibilities."
The supervisor should also consider all the performance agreements completed during the appraisal period for temporary assignments.
Do not include ROTERs in the Summary Narrative; ROTERs are not an indication of whether the employee performed well against the critical performance expectations.
"Note: For additional information on ROTERs, see IRM 1.5.2, Managing Section 1204 Statistics in a Balanced Measurement System, Uses of Statistics."
"In completing the Summary Narrative:
Be concise, but descriptive enough to give the next level reviewer an accurate picture of the strengths, development needs, and overall effectiveness of the employee."
Focus on what is important for that particular job and the performance agreement.
"Be clear about whether the employee exceeds, meets, or does not meet the Commitments or Objectives and Responsibilities."
Ensure that the Summary Narrative is consistent with the focus of the commitments or objectives and responsibilities outlined in the performance agreement.
"While the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers is not normally addressed in the Summary Narrative, it must be discussed if the rating for the Retention Standard is ""Not Met."""
"6.430.3.5.4 (10-28-2011)
Rating Critical Performance Expectations
The supervisor must use the rating definitions found in this section."
"6.430.3.5.4.1 (01-01-2007)
Rating Responsibilities
The supervisor assigns one of the rating levels to all of the responsibilities based on the definitions provided below:
Exceeded: In addition to placing appropriate emphasis on the five sets of responsibilities, served as a role model in one or more of the five sets."
Actions taken were exemplary in promoting accomplishment of the annual business plan and strategic goals.
Met: Placed appropriate emphasis on each of the five sets of responsibilities.
Appropriate actions were taken to support accomplishment of the annual business plan and strategic goals.
Not Met: Placed insufficient emphasis on one or more sets of responsibilities.
"Actions taken were inappropriate, ineffective, or undermined strategic goals or annual business plan accomplishment."
"6.430.3.5.4.2 (01-01-2007)
Rating Commitments or Objectives
The supervisor assigns one of the following rating levels to all of the Commitments or Objectives based on the definitions provided below:
Exceeded: Overcame significant obstacles, such as insufficient resources, conflicting demands, or unusually short time frames, in achieving or exceeding desired results."
Met: Achieved or made substantial progress toward achievement of desired results.
Not Met: Did not achieve or make substantial progress toward achievement of desired results.
"6.430.3.5.4.3 (06-12-2009)
Rating Performance Against the Retention Standard For the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers
The supervisor will determine whether the employee has performed duties with potential impact on taxpayer issues or outcomes during the appraisal period."
"If the employee has performed such duties, the supervisor will determine whether the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers has been met."
"If a rating of ""Not Met"" is determined, the supervisor must contact the servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office for guidance."
"Failure of the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers will result in a summary evaluation of ""Not Met."""
"If the employee has not performed duties with potential impact on taxpayer issues or outcomes during the appraisal period, the supervisor should check the ""Not Applicable"" block on the performance agreement."
"6.430.3.5.4.4 (01-01-2007)
Rating Performance Against the National Security Critical Element
The supervisor will consider whether the employee has performed duties concerning the handling of national security information on a regular basis during the appraisal period for all employees who are assigned this element."
"If the employee has performed such duties, the supervisor will determine whether the critical element has been met."
"If a rating of ""Not Met"" is determined, the supervisor must contact the servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office for guidance."
"Failure of the National Security critical element will result in a summary evaluation of ""Not Met."""
"If the employee has not handled classified national security information during the appraisal period, the supervisor should check the ""Not applicable"" block on the Classified National Security Information Critical Element form."
"6.430.3.5.5 (10-28-2011)
Assigning the Summary Evaluation Rating
The summary evaluation provides one rating for the combined performance against the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers, the Responsibilities, and the Commitments or Objectives."
The supervisor must also consider the rating for the National Security Critical Element for those managers or management officials who are covered by that element.
Failure of the National Security Critical Element is treated in the same manner as the failure of the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers.
"The summary evaluation balances the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers, Responsibilities, and Commitments or Objectives for the final rating and ties the Commitments or Objectives directly to the five Responsibilities and should ensure balance among all of the Responsibilities."
"The supervisor should only assign the annual summary evaluation at the end of the appraisal period for an employee who is on a permanent assignment or who is on a temporary promotion or detail at the end of the employees appraisal period and meets the conditions specified in IRM 6.430.5.3, IRM 6.430.5.4, and IRM 6.430.5.5."
"Note: See IRM 6.430.5, Performance Appraisals for Temporary Assignments, for more information about performance appraisals for temporary assignments."
"Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations prohibit setting quotas for summary evaluation ratings (i.e., a forced distribution of summary levels)."
Supervisors can complete a rating up to 364 days following the end of the appraisal period.
Lengthy delays should be extremely rare due to the potentially negative impact on both the individual and the organization.
The approving official has final authority to approve the summary rating.
It is not necessary for the supervisor to have observed the employees performance under a signed performance agreement for 60 days or more.
"However, the employees performance must have been observed by at least one other supervisor under a signed agreement for a minimum of 60 days within the appraisal period."
"In rare cases, it may be necessary to extend the appraisal period until the minimum 60 days has been met."
Note: See IRM 6.430.3.4.1.3 for more information on extending the appraisal period.
"If the employee has insufficient performance during the appraisal period to be assigned a rating of record, the employee will be designated ""Not Ratable"" for that period."
"Note: For additional information on ""Not Ratable"" determinations, see IRM 6.430.3.5.4."
"6.430.3.5.5.1 (10-28-2011)
Definitions for Summary Evaluations
The supervisor assigns the summary evaluation rating level based on the employees performance in his or her Responsibilities, Commitments, or Objectives and the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers using the definitions provided below:
Outstanding - The incumbent met the Retention Standard and performed as a model of excellence by exceeding responsibilities and commitments (or objectives) in his or her Agreement, despite constantly changing priorities, insufficient or unanticipated resource shortages, and externally driven deadlines."
He or she consistently demonstrated the highest level of integrity and performance in promoting the annual business plans and the Service's strategic goals and objectives.
His or her contributions had impact beyond his or her purview.
Exceeded - The incumbent met the Retention Standard and generally exceeded both the responsibilities and commitments (or objectives) in his/her Agreement.
"However, he or she may have met the Retention Standard and demonstrated exceptional performance in either responsibilities or commitments (or objectives) and met the expectations of the other."
"He or she may have overcome significant organizational challenges such as coordination with external stakeholders (National Treasury Employees Union, Congress, etc.)"
or insufficient resources.
His or her effectiveness and contributions may have had impact beyond his or her purview.
"Met - The incumbent met the Retention Standard and the responsibilities and commitments (or objectives) in his or her Agreement with solid, dependable performance."
Incumbent consistently demonstrates the ability to meet the requirements of the job.
Challenges encountered and resolved are part of the day to day operation and are generally routine in nature.
"Minimally Satisfactory - The incumbent met the Retention Standard and all responsibilities and commitments (or objectives), however, overall performance contains deficiencies which warrant improvement."
"Not Met - The incumbent failed to meet the Retention Standard, responsibilities, and/or commitments (or objectives)."
"Repeated observations of performance indicated negative consequences in key outcomes (e.g., quality, timeliness, business results, morale, etc.)."
Immediate improvement is essential.
"6.430.3.5.6 (06-12-2009)
Probation on Initial Appointment to a Competitive Position
A new employee begins his or her regularly scheduled annual appraisal period upon entrance on duty."
This may be at any point in the period of October 1 through September 30.
A supervisor should begin monitoring a new employee immediately to determine if the employee is willing and able to perform the work and is otherwise suited for retention in the position.
"Although formal performance improvement plans are not required for employees who are serving probationary periods, a supervisor should provide an employee who is not meeting his or her Responsibilities and Commitments or Objectives with enough information to help the employee understand how he or she is failing and how the employee might improve."
"Upon determination that a probationary employee either will not or cannot meet expectations, the supervisor must begin action to terminate the employee from his or her position and/or from Federal service."
"A rating of ""Met"" or higher rendered early during a probationary or trial period does not preclude a subsequent decision that the employee is not performing at expected levels or otherwise suitable to be retained."
"However, a supervisor should be able to provide specific examples either:
How performance and/or conduct deteriorated after the rating was assigned, or
How the conduct used to support the termination was unrelated to the performance appraisal."
"Supervisors should consult with the servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office regarding any performance rating of ""Not Met"" to ensure that all parties understand the implications of failing to improve."
"6.430.3.5.7 (01-01-2007)
Probation on Initial Appointment to a Supervisory/Managerial Position
Employees serving probationary periods for initial appointments to supervisory/managerial positions who do not meet expectations set forth in performance plans that relate to supervisory/managerial responsibilities will be returned to non-supervisory positions."
That decision can be made at any time during the one year probationary period.
"Although formal notice and opportunity to improve are not required, supervisors generally should provide at least enough information so that the new supervisor understands specific deficiencies in time to make corrections."
"A rating of ""Met"" or higher rendered early during the supervisory/managerial probationary period does not preclude a subsequent decision that the individual is not successfully performing the supervisory/managerial aspects of his or her position."
"However, a supervisor should be able to provide specific examples of deficiencies that occurred after the rating was rendered."
Decisions to remove probationary employees may be made at any time during the probationary period.
"Supervisors should consult with the servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office regarding any performance rating of ""Not Met"" to ensure that all parties understand the implications of failing to improve."
"6.430.3.6 (10-28-2011)
Additional Reasons for Performance Appraisals
The employee's annual appraisal is the most commonly given performance appraisal and becomes the employee's rating of record."
"Other performance appraisals, however, may be issued for specialized circumstances."
Some of these appraisals may also be used as the employee's rating of record.
"Note: For more information on the various reasons for performance appraisals, see Exhibit 6.430.2-3, and for more information about performance appraisal requirements for temporary assignments, see IRM 6.430.5."
"6.430.3.6.1 (10-28-2011)
Departure Appraisals
A departure appraisal is a performance appraisal prepared when either the supervisor or employee moves from a permanent or temporary assignment to another permanent or temporary assignment."
The employee must have been provided a performance agreement and served in the position for a minimum of 60 days to receive a departure appraisal.
"Each critical performance expectation is given a rating; however, a summary evaluation is not assigned unless the employee or supervisor departs his or her position within the last 60 days of the appraisal period and the appraisal becomes the rating of record."
"Types of departure appraisals:
Supervisor Departure: If a supervisor departs his or her position, a departure appraisal must be prepared for the employees under the supervisor's work unit."
"If the employee being rated is a manager or management official, the departure appraisal will become the employee's rating of record if the supervisor's departure occurs within the last 60 days of the employee's appraisal period."
"Employee Departure: If an employee departs his or her position, the supervisor must prepare a departure appraisal for that employee."
The employee's departure appraisal will become his or her rating of record if the departure occurs within the last 60 days of the employee's appraisal period.
"If not within the last 60 days, the employee's new supervisor will consider the departure appraisal when preparing the employee's rating of record."
"If a supervisor is assigned to a new organization and the employee accompanies the supervisor to the new organization and will occupy the same position, a departure appraisal is not required."
The supervisor must sign the departure appraisal and provide a copy to the employee for the employee's signature.
The approving official's signature is not required unless the departure appraisal will become the employee's rating of record.
"All departure appraisals must either be sent to the employee's new office (with the employee's EPF), if the employee is changing positions, or placed in the employee's EPF when the supervisor changes positions."
The rating official should consider all departure appraisals as input for preparation of the employees annual rating of record.
Departure appraisals are not required for employees leaving the IRS and not going to other Federal employment.
"For example, departure appraisals are not required for employees who resign or retire."
"6.430.3.6.2 (10-28-2011)
Appraisals for Merit Promotion
The employee's most recent rating of record will be used for merit promotion in nearly all cases."
A supervisor may prepare a new performance appraisal for merit promotion purposes only when the employee is newly hired or has returned to duty after a lengthy absence and has no rating of record on file.
"To be provided a merit promotion appraisal after a lengthy absence, the employee must not have had at least 60 days of performance under a signed performance agreement for the most recently completed appraisal period."
The newly hired employee must have been on board for at least 90 days after an initial appointment.
"In either instance, the employee must meet the minimum appraisal period requirements for the current appraisal period."
These merit promotion appraisals cannot be used as the employee's rating of record and are valid only for the specific merit promotion action.
"Since a merit promotion appraisal cannot become a rating of record, no approving official signature is required and no summary evaluation is assigned."
"Managers, management officials, and confidential management and program analysts who apply for bargaining unit positions must have their most recently completed performance appraisal converted to the performance appraisal form used for bargaining unit employees."
"Exhibit 6.335.1-4 of IRM 6.335, Promotion and Internal Placement, contains guidance on how that is accomplished."
"For a ""Not Ratable"" employee who has served 90 days on a competitive appointment but not served 60 cumulative days under a signed performance agreement, the supervisor must submit a statement to the servicing Employment Office indicating that the employee is ""Not Ratable."""
"These ""Not Ratable"" employees cannot receive any type of performance appraisal for merit promotion, even a ""presumptive"" Fully Successful appraisal."
"Employment Offices will not accept ""presumptive"" Fully Successful appraisals for merit promotion."
"6.430.3.6.3 (10-28-2011)
Within-Grade Increase (WIGI) Determination
The OPM regulations require that the decision to grant or deny a WIGI must be supported by the employee's most recent rating of record."
"If the most recent rating of record does not support the decision, a new rating must be prepared."
"A new rating of record is required when:
A WIGI was previously denied and the employee's performance has improved to the ""Fully Successful"" level making the employee eligible for a WIGI."
"The employee's most recent rating of record is at least ""Met"" but the employee's performance has now decreased below that level which would make the employee no longer eligible for the WIGI."
This rating of record prepared to support or deny the WIGI becomes the employee's new rating of record for all purposes.
"6.430.3.6.4 (10-28-2011)
Not Ratable Determinations
A supervisor may be unable to rate an employee at the end of the performance appraisal period, in which case no rating of record shall be recorded for the employee for that appraisal period."
"Examples of ""Not Ratable"" situations :
The employee was not assigned an approved performance plan for his or her position for at least 60 days during the appraisal period;
The employee is newly-hired and does not have 60 days remaining in his or her performance appraisal period;
The employee was on extended leave and did not have at least 60 days of performance during the appraisal period;
The employee was detailed to a position excluded from the performance appraisal requirements in 5 CFR Part 430, by law, or other OPM regulation."
"If the supervisor determines that the employee is ""Not Ratable"" at the end of the employees designated performance appraisal period, the supervisor must complete the performance agreement in the automated performance appraisal system and indicate that the employee is ""Not Ratable"" and specify the reason for that determination in the space provided."
"In those cases where an non paybanded employee cannot be rated, the employee may be granted a ""Waiver of Requirement for Determination"" for a WIGI as specified in 5 CFR 531.409(d)."
"6.430.3.6.5 (06-12-2009)
Retroactive Appraisals
The OPM regulations and IRS policy prohibit retroactive ratings of record."
"The OPM regulations (5 CFR 430.208(i)) do not permit the assignment of a rating of record for an earlier appraisal period, if a rating was assigned for a subsequent period or if the agency's established deadline for providing a rating of record has passed."
"It is the Service's policy that supervisors can effect a rating of record up to 364 days following the end of the employee's appraisal period, unless a rating of record for a later period has been completed."
"Once that 364 day period has passed, no rating of record can be assigned for the previous appraisal period."
"Exceptions include appraisals changed as a result of:
A grievance, complaint, or other formal proceedings permitted by law or regulation."
When the Service determines that a rating of record was incorrectly recorded or calculated.
"6.430.3.6.6 (01-01-2007)
Presumptive Ratings
Presumptive ratings for ratings of record are prohibited by 5 CFR 430.208 (a)(2)."
A rating of record can be based only on the evaluation of actual job performance for the designated performance appraisal period.
A supervisor must not issue a rating of record that assumes a level of performance by an employee without an actual evaluation of that employee's performance.
"6.430.3.7 (01-01-2007)
Conducting the Performance Appraisal Meeting
The performance appraisal is final when it is issued to the employee with all appropriate reviews and signatures."
"Thus, the appraisal should not be discussed with the employee until all appropriate reviews and signatures have been completed."
"For positions covered by Performance Review Boards (PRB), the performance appraisal is not considered final until the PRB has completed its process."
"The supervisor should begin the performance appraisal meeting by reviewing the employee's self-assessment, focusing on the areas of agreement between the self-assessment and the supervisor's assessment of the employee's performance."
"During the performance appraisal meeting, the supervisor should share a copy of the completed performance agreement with the employee and discuss openly the ratings and rationale for those ratings, with an eye towards reaching consensus."
"For areas of disagreement, the supervisor should determine if any information was overlooked."
"The supervisor should consider the following when conducting an appraisal meeting:
Always acknowledge the areas of outstanding performance, as well as the areas for improvement to give balance to the appraisal."
Cite specific examples to demonstrate current performance as well as examples of behavior/results that might occur at the next higher level of performance.
Focus on the future by jointly developing a plan of action to improve performance.
Follow a problem solving approach.
Discuss key areas for improvement by defining specific solutions to performance issues without assigning blame.
Manage the emotions involved with evaluating performance.
"Allow the employee to communicate his or her concerns, listen carefully to the concerns, and provide constructive feedback."
"In some cases, it may be useful to postpone the remainder of the meeting so both participants can regroup."
"If disagreements cannot be resolved between the employee and the supervisor, the employee may provide a written response, which becomes an attachment to the performance agreement."
The supervisor should inform the employee about the effect of the rating of record on the salary review process under an IRS Payband System.
The employee should sign and date the performance agreement at the conclusion of the performance appraisal meeting.
"After current performance has been discussed, the supervisor may decide that it would be useful to discuss the expectations for the next appraisal cycle by conducting the activities outlined in Step 1, Planning Expectations."
Often a separate meeting is required to plan future performance goals and should be scheduled as soon as practical.
"6.430.3.7.1 (10-28-2011)
Evaluation of Managerial Potential
Supervisors are also required to discuss Form 13236, Evaluation of Managerial Potential (EMP)."
The EMP is completed at the end of each appraisal period to identify leadership competencies for development and to determine potential in the competitive process.
Recently many managers completed the four stages of the Leadership Succession Review (LSR) assessment which also identifies leadership competencies for development.
"Until further notice, managers who have completed all four stages of the LSR will not be required to complete the EMP annually as part of the appraisal process."
Managers who have not completed all four stages of the LSR assessment will continue to complete the EMP as part of the annual appraisal process.
Note: In the near future the EMP will be obsoleted and be replaced with LSR leadership competency ratings in the Merit System Promotion competitive process.
"Management officials, confidential management/program analysts, and other first time applicants for management positions may request the form be completed at any time; however, once completed, their EMP will remain in effect for the duration of their performance cycle."
"For additional information on the EMP form, visit the Management Selection Program Resource Center web site at http:/hco.web.irs.gov/recruitstaff/internalplac/meritpromo/msp/index.html."
"6.430.3.8 (06-12-2009)
Processing the Signed Performance Appraisal
Both the rating official and approving official must sign the performance appraisal for it to be used as the rating of record."
"The approving official has the final authority to approve, modify, or disapprove the summary evaluation rating."
The employee is not required to sign the performance appraisal.
"If the employee chooses not to sign, the supervisor should document the employee's refusal."
The supervisor should inform the employee that refusal to acknowledge receipt of the appraisal does not render the rating of record invalid.
"The original, completed performance agreement form must be filed in the employees EPF along with any back-up documentation and any accompanying narratives or self-assessments."
The supervisor must ensure that the employees annual appraisal is entered into the Services automated performance appraisal system by the required date.
"6.430.3.9 (10-28-2011)
Tracking Performance Agreements
The supervisor should review and take actions based on the information provided in ePerformance or based on the information provided in the Pay Period Performance Management Listings Reports available on the HR Reporting Center website."
"ePerformance reports provide information to the supervisor related to performance management responsibilities including:
Printable Performance Plans."
Award Election Report.
Status Summary Report.
Missing Performance Documents.
Performance Document Status.
Documents Pending Rating Review.
The Pay Period Performance Management Listings Reports are available to each supervisor and each business unit via the HR Reporting Center website.
Supervisors may initiate an OL5081 for access as appropriate for their business unit.
"These reports provide information to the supervisor related to performance management responsibilities including:
Annual ratings due/overdue status,
Employee due/overdue eligibility status for WIGI, and
Last rating of record and rating dates input in the automated personnel system."
"6.430.3.10 (10-28-2011)
Reconsidering the Summary Evaluation
Employees are encouraged to resolve matters of disagreement concerning the summary evaluation with their rating official and approving official."
"An employee who is dissatisfied with his or her summary evaluation may ask for reconsideration from the approving official in lieu of, or in addition to, adding comments to the evaluation."
"If the informal problem solving, as described in (2), is not successful, managers, management officials, and confidential management/program analysts may request reconsideration of their performance appraisal by filing an agency grievance within the time specified in IRM 6.771.1, Internal Revenue Service, Agency Grievance System (AGS)."
"Managers, management officials, and confidential management/program analysts should follow the IRS Agency Grievance System procedures specified in IRM 6.771.1, to request reconsideration of their performance appraisals."
Employees may also consult their servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office to discuss reconsideration procedures.
Any change to the overall rating must be reviewed against the critical performance expectations of the position to ensure the appropriateness of the changed rating.
"6.430.3.11 (06-12-2009)
Amending a Rating
A rating may be amended after it is given to the employee for reasons such as:
Reconsideration by the rating official resulting from an informal request by the employee within 60 days of issuance."
Discovery of an error in recording or calculating the rating of record.
Changes directed as the resolution of a formal complaint procedure.
A change in the employee's performance after the end of the appraisal period is not a justification for amending a rating.
"The following steps should be followed to amend a rating of Record:
The supervisor selects Rework Rating from the document in ePerformance."
The appraisal period remains the same as the original.
"All parties of the original rating should sign the amended rating (employee, rating official, and reviewing official)."
The amended rating must not contain documentation in any section of the form that would indicate the evaluation is the result of a grievance or any similar action.
(This includes the performance notes section of the online document.)
The original copy of the amended form should be placed in the employees EPF.
The previous rating will be destroyed and replaced with the corrected rating.
"6.430.3.12 (10-28-2011)
Step 4: Recognizing Performance
The supervisor may recognize strong performance through informal acknowledgements and formal recognition."
Note: See IRM 6.451 Employee Performance and Utilization - Awards and Recognition or the Awards and Recognition web page at http://hco.web.irs.gov/perfmgmt/awards/index.html for additional information.
Newly-hired employees covered by the IRS Payband System who do not meet the IRS minimum appraisal period or do not have a rating of record from another Federal agency for the current performance appraisal period will not be eligible for a performance bonus or performance-based increase.
"However, employees with a rating of record from another Federal agency or a rating based on another IRS pay system (e.g., GS, WG) will be eligible for the lowest performance-based increase granted and may be eligible for a performance award based on their prior award program."
Note: See the Payband Resource Center for Managers for more information on manager performance bonuses at http://hco.web.irs.gov/apps/payband/index.htm .

6.430.4.1 (01-01-2007)
Overview of Performance and Reduction in Force
Performance is one of the four retention factors used in reduction in force (RIF) as outlined in 5 USC 3501 - 3503."
This IRM section specifies the policies and procedures that the IRS uses in determining the proper retention service credit for performance ratings in a competitive area undergoing a RIF.
"6.430.4.2 (01-01-2007)
Performance Appraisals Used for RIF
Only a rating of record or an equivalent rating of record may be used as the basis for granting retention service credit in RIF."
"An equivalent rating of record means a performance evaluation not given under 5 CFR 430, Subpart B, but meeting the following requirements:
Was issued as an officially designated evaluation under the employing agency's performance evaluation system."
Was derived from the appraisal of performance against expectations that were established and communicated in advance and were work related.
Identified whether the employee performed acceptably.
"To be used as the employee's rating of record, an IRS performance appraisal must:
Be completed on an officially designated performance appraisal form appropriate to the employee's position of record."
Contain the signatures of the rating official/rater and reviewing/approving official.
Have been provided to the employee.
Contain an overall rating or summary evaluation and a rating for the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers (when appropriate).
Be based on the evaluation of actual job performance for the designated appraisal period.
Be retained by the rating official in the employee's Employee Performance File (EPF).
Be entered into the Service's automated personnel system.
"Ratings of Record from other Federal agencies and Treasury bureaus may be accepted for RIF purposes if they are given under the requirements of Subpart B, Part 430, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations or meet the requirements of an equivalent rating of record specified above."
"6.430.4.3 (01-01-2007)
Amount of Credit for Performance
Each employee in a competitive area undergoing a RIF receives additional retention service credit for performance based on the average of the employee's three most recent ratings of record received the 4-year period prior to the date the IRS freezes ratings before issuing specific RIF notices."
"The IRS will provide additional retention service credit to the employees under the same summary rating pattern in additional years of service on the basis of the mathematical average of each employee's ratings of record:
20 additional years of service for each rating of record of "" Outstanding"" or equivalent summary (Level 5);
16 additional years of service for each rating of record of "" Exceeds Fully Successful"" or equivalent summary (Level 4); and
12 additional years of service for each rating of record of "" Fully Successful"" or equivalent summary (Level 3)."
"The IRS may not give any additional retention service credit for ratings of record of ""Minimally Successful"" or equivalent (Level 2), or ""Unacceptable"" or equivalent summary (Level 1)."
"If the average is a fraction, the Service will round up the fraction to the next higher whole number."
"6.430.4.4 (05-06-2011)
Use of a Cutoff Date in RIF
The IRS has established the use of a cutoff date of a minimum of 60 days prior to the planned issuance of the specific RIF notices to freeze ratings of record from being used in a RIF."
The purpose of the cutoff date is to provide sufficient time to properly determine employees' retention standings prior to a RIF.
The cutoff date must be stated as a specified number of days occurring prior to the issuance of the specific RIF notices.
"After this cutoff date, no new ratings of record may be put on the record and used for RIF purposes."
"Ratings of record received after the cutoff date may still be used for other purposes such as awards, merit promotion actions, etc."
"Note: To be put ""on the record"" means the completed valid performance appraisal is entered into the Service's automated personnel system and is available for use in a RIF."
The performance appraisal cutoff date may be longer than 60 days based on the results of negotiations with the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU).
No annual performance appraisal will be completed before the ending date of the employee's appraisal period to circumvent the specified cutoff date.
"The only exceptions to the prohibition of early appraisals are:
A departure appraisal prepared for an employee who permanently departs his or her position within the last 60 days of the employee's appraisal period."
A departure appraisal prepared for an employee whose supervisor is departing his or her position within the last 60 days of the employee's appraisal period.
Note: These departure appraisals become the employee's rating of record.
See IRM 6.430.2.5.1 and 6.430.3.5.1 for more information on departure appraisals used as ratings of record.
"6.430.4.5 (01-01-2007)
Missing Ratings of Record
If an employee in a competitive area undergoing a RIF has not received three actual ratings of record during the applicable 4-year period prior to the date the IRS freezes ratings, the IRS provides additional retention service credit using the following procedures:
An employee who has received at least one but fewer than three previous ratings of record during the applicable 4-year period receives retention service credit for performance on the basis of the value of the actual rating(s) of record divided by the number of actual ratings received."
An employee who has not received any rating of record during the applicable 4-year period receives retention service credit for performance based on the modal rating for the summary level pattern that applies to the employee's official position of record at the time of the RIF.
"Examples : The modal rating would be necessary for an employee who did not receive a rating of record for a variety of reasons (e.g., active military duty, injury compensation, an assignment under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act, work on behalf of a collective bargaining unit, or insufficient time in a pay status for a seasonal employee)."
"6.430.4.6 (01-01-2007)
Use of the Modal Rating
The modal rating is the summary rating level assigned most frequently among the actual ratings of record that are:
Assigned under the summary level pattern that applies to the employee's official position of record on the date of the RIF."
Given within the same competitive area.
On the record (issued to the employee with all appropriate reviews and signatures).
For the most recently completed appraisal period prior to the cutoff date the IRS specifies prior to the issuance of notices after which no new ratings will be put on the record.
The IRS bases the modal rating on the competitive area undergoing a RIF.
"At the time a RIF is contemplated for a competitive area, the Service will review the affected employees' records to determine if the use of modal ratings will be necessary."
"If one or more employees in the competitive area do not have at least one rating of record during the previous 4- year period, the modal rating is calculated separately for each competitive area facing a RIF."
There is no requirement for the IRS either to determine or to use modal ratings when every employee in the competitive area has at least one rating of record during the applicable 4-year time period.
The modal rating can only used for RIF purposes.
"6.430.4.7 (01-01-2007)
Multiple Rating Patterns
Although all IRS employees have five summary rating levels (e.g."
"""Outstanding,"" ""Exceeds Fully Successful"" ) based on their IRS performance, some employees in a competitive area may have performance ratings from other Federal agencies or Treasury bureaus."
These performance ratings may be under more than one pattern of summary levels as specified in 5 CFR 430.208.
"In the event that a competitive area undergoing a RIF has employees with ratings of record under other summary rating patterns, the IRS is required to consider the mix of rating patterns and to specify additional retention service credit for employees who have the same summary level, but are under different patterns."
The range of additional service credit is still limited from 12 to 20 years.
Exhibit 6.430.4-1 shows the amount of additional years of retention service credit for performance provided to employees undergoing a RIF and who have a different summary rating pattern.

6.430.5.1 (06-12-2009)
Coverage
This section describes the manner in which employees who are serving on temporary assignments anticipated to last 60 days or more receive performance appraisals that may become ratings of record."
"Temporary assignments include temporary promotions whether competitive or non competitive, and details to a different position with a not to exceed date."
The requirements of this section are intended to be read in context with the remainder of IRM 6.430.
"6.430.5.2 (01-01-2007)
General Requirements
An employee on a temporary assignment within the Service such as a detail or temporary promotion must receive a performance plan as soon as possible (no later than 30 days) from the beginning of each temporary assignment expected to last at least 60 days."
The performance plan should reflect the employee’s performance expectations for the duration of the temporary assignment.
"Although a temporary assignment may not be anticipated to last 60 days, management must provide to the employee a performance plan once the temporary assignment is expected to last at least 60 days."
A departure appraisal reflecting the employee’s performance on a temporary assignment of 60 days or more must be prepared by the supervisor of the employee’s temporary assignment position when the employee departs the temporary assignment.
These departure appraisals do not require the reviewing official’s signature since they will not become the employee’s rating of record.
The supervisor of the employee’s position of record must consider all departure appraisals for temporary assignments that occurred during the appraisal period when preparing the employee’s annual rating of record.
Mid-year progress reviews are required even if the employee is serving on a detail or temporary promotion.
"Normally, the permanent supervisor will be responsible for conducting the progress review."
"However, when the employee is serving on a long-term temporary assignment, it may be more appropriate for the supervisor of the employee’s temporary assignment to conduct a progress review."
"Note: For additional information on mid-year progress reviews, see IRM 6.430.2.3.2 for employees evaluated by critical job elements and IRM 6.430.3.3.1 for managers and management officials."
Management should consider the effect on performance appraisals when temporarily assigning employees for extended periods.
"6.430.5.3 (06-12-2009)
Appraisals for Temporary Promotions to GS Positions
These requirements for appraisals for temporary promotions only apply to GS and Internal Revenue (IR) employees who are temporarily promoted to GS and equivalent positions (e.g., WG, GM, and GL)."
Temporary promotions of employees that involve movement into or within the IR payband are covered by the requirements found in IRM 6.430.5.5.1.
An employee who receives a temporary promotion to a position that is anticipated to last for 60 days or more will receive a performance plan reflecting the performance expectations of the temporary promotion position.
"Normally, the employee’s permanent supervisor will prepare the employee’s rating of record on the performance plan of employee’s permanent position."
This rating of record will include feedback from the temporary promotion supervisor as appropriate.
"Exception: The supervisor of the employee’s temporary promotion position will prepare the rating of record on the performance plan of the temporary promotion position if the following two conditions are met:

The temporary promotion was of sufficient duration that the employee is not ratable for the permanent position (i.e., less than 60 days of performance during the appraisal period), and
The employee’s performance appraisal period ended while the employee was serving in the temporary promotion position."
Employees who are temporarily promoted into a position for 60 days or more assume the performance appraisal period ending date of the temporary assignment.
"However, the employee will not receive a rating of record for the temporary promotion position unless the conditions described in IRM 6.430.5.3 (3 ) above are met (i.e., the employee does not meet the minimum performance period to be rated for the permanent position)."
Example 1 - A bargaining unit employee on a performance appraisal cycle based on the employee’s SSN receives a temporary promotion for 120 days to another bargaining unit position.
"While in the temporary assignment, the employee’s performance appraisal period ends based on the employee’s SSN."
"As long as the employee had at least 60 days of performance in the permanent position at the end of the employee’s appraisal period, the employee would receive a rating of record based on the permanent position."
The employee’s temporary promotion supervisor would provide performance feedback to the employee’s permanent supervisor for consideration in the employee’s next rating of record.
Example 2 – A management official on the fiscal year performance appraisal cycle receives a temporary promotion to a bargaining unit position for 120 days.
"While in this temporary assignment, the employee’s performance appraisal period ends based on the SSN cycle."
"Since the employee served at least 60 days in the permanent position at the end of the performance appraisal period based on the SSN cycle, the employee would not receive a rating of record based on the performance plan for the temporary promotion position but remain on the performance appraisal cycle of the permanent position."
It is possible for an employee to receive more than one rating of record in a year based on movement between a permanent position and a temporary promotion position with a different performance appraisal cycle.
Each rating of record is considered valid for the period covered even though the appraisal period is less than one year for an employee with multiple ratings of record during the annual appraisal period.
"In addition, none of the performance appraisal periods for these ratings of record may overlap."
"In these cases, the employee’s most recently completed rating of record becomes the employee’s current rating of record for all purposes such as reduction in force, awards, and merit promotion."
Example: A bargaining unit employee with an appraisal period of December 1 to November 30 receives a temporary promotion to a supervisory position for the period of January 1 to September 30.
The employee’s temporary promotion appraisal period now ends on September 30 (fiscal year cycle).
"The employee receives a rating of record on October 1 on the Manager Performance Agreement because:


The performance period ends while the employee is on temporary promotion, and
The employee is not ratable for the permanent position since the employee has less than 60 days of performance in that position during the appraisal period."
The employee returns to his or her permanent bargaining unit position on October 1.
"On November 30, the employee’s appraisal period ends for the permanent bargaining unit position and the employee’s receives a new rating of record on Form 6850-BU for the period of October 1 to November 30 since this period meets the minimum appraisal period of 60 days."
This November 30 performance appraisal becomes the employee’s current rating of record.
"If the performance appraisal period does not end while the employee is on the temporary promotion, the employee will receive a departure appraisal from the temporary promotion supervisor for any assignment that lasted 60 days or more."
This departure appraisal is furnished to the employee’s permanent supervisor for consideration in the employee’s next scheduled rating of record.
"For more information on appraisals for temporary promotions from IR positions to GS positions, see the Job Aid Rating Employees on Temporary Promotions IR to GS found at http://hco.web.irs.gov/pdf/irtempromojobaid.PDF."
"6.430.5.4 (06-12-2009)
Appraisals for Details to GS Positions
These requirements for appraisals for details apply to GS and equivalent positions (e.g., WG, GM, GL) only."
"Details of IR payband employees that involve movement into, within, or out of the payband are covered by the requirements found in IRM 6.430.5.5.2."
An employee detailed to a position that is expected to last 60 days or more will receive a performance plan reflecting the performance expectations of the detail.
The employee will receive a departure appraisal from the supervisor of the detail position for his or her performance at the end of any detail that lasted 60 days or more.
This departure appraisal is furnished to the employee’s permanent supervisor for consideration in the employee’s next scheduled rating of record.
A departure appraisal for performance on a detail can never be used as the employee’s rating of record.
The supervisor of an employee’s detail assignment cannot prepare the employee’s annual performance appraisal that is used as the rating of record.
An employee detailed to another position maintains the performance period ending date of the permanent position.
Example: A bargaining unit employee whose performance cycle is based on the SSN is detailed to a management official position for one year.
"Although the management official’s performance appraisal period is based on the fiscal year, the employee retains the SSN cycle and receives an annual appraisal based on his or her SSN."
The detailed employee’s annual appraisal is completed on the employee’s permanent performance plan by the permanent supervisor with feedback received from the supervisor of the detail.
The employee’s permanent supervisor must request and obtain a departure appraisal from the employee’s detail supervisor.
It is the responsibility of the employee’s permanent supervisor as the rating official to ensure that the employee’s accomplishments on the detail are considered in the employee’s annual appraisal as appropriate.
"6.430.5.5 (06-12-2009)
Appraisals for Temporary Assignments of IR Payband Employees
It is the IRS policy to compensate an employee occupying an IR payband position consistent with the employee’s performance as it is measured by the annual summary performance evaluation."
The pay is designed to recognize performance in accordance with the pay administration rules for the IR paybands.
Performance appraisals for temporary assignments for IR payband employees that involve movement out of the payband for an extended period require special considerations since the employee’s performance as reflected in the performance appraisal has significant impact on the employee’s pay.
It is important for management to be aware of the performance management ramifications of temporary assignments in and out of payband positions to ensure employees are not adversely affected by these temporary assignments.
IRM 6.430.5 does not address the IRS policies on pay administration for IR paybands.
"For more information on pay administration for IR paybands, see the Staffing and Pay Administration Policies for the IRS Payband System, (PPD-9509-02P12) at http://hco.web.irs.gov/policies/intrmguide/1perpolicy.html."
More information on IR paybands for IRS managers may be found in the Manager's Payband Resource Center at http://hco.web.irs.gov/apps/payband/index.htm.
"6.430.5.5.1 (01-01-2007)
Appraisals for Temporary Promotions to IR Positions
These requirements for appraisals for temporary promotions which involve movement into or within the IR payband apply to IR employees only."
Temporary promotions of employees into the GS system are covered by the requirements found in IRM 6.430.5.3.
"A GS employee serving on a temporary promotion to an IR position or an IR employee serving on a temporary promotion to a higher IR position at the end of the appraisal period (i.e., September 30) will be evaluated on the employee’s permanent GS or IR position."
"Exception: If the employee is not ratable for his or her permanent position (i.e., the employee has not served the minimum appraisal period of 60 days), the employee will be evaluated on the IR temporary promotion position."
The employee will be placed in the bonus pool that covers the position on which the employee’s annual rating of record was based.
Example: A bargaining unit employee who has a performance appraisal cycle based on the employee’s SSN is temporarily promoted to an IR manager position for one year.
"While serving on the temporary promotion, the performance appraisal period for managers ends on September 30."
"As long as the employee did not have 60 days or more of performance in the permanent position on September 30, the employee would receive a rating of record based on the IR manager temporary promotion position prepared by the supervisor of the temporary promotion position."
"In the event that a GS or IR employee received more than one IR temporary promotion during the appraisal period and is not ratable for that employee’s permanent position, the employee will receive his or her annual rating of record based on the IR temporary promotion position of the longest duration that occurred during the appraisal period."
The employee will be placed in the bonus pool that covers the temporary IR position on which the employee’s annual rating of record was based.
"For more information on appraisals for temporary promotions to IR positions, see the Job Aid Rating Employees on Temporary Promotions IR to IR and GS to IR found at http://hco.web.irs.gov/pdf/irtemppromojobaid.PDF
6.430.5.5.2 (06-12-2009)
Appraisals for Details to, from, or within IR Positions
These requirements for appraisals for details that involve movement into, within, or out of the IR payband apply to IR positions only."
Details of GS employees are covered by the requirements found in IRM 6.430.5.4.
An IR employee who receives a detail to a GS or IR position that is anticipated to last for 60 days or more will receive a performance plan reflecting the performance expectations of the detail position.
"Normally, the employee’s permanent supervisor will prepare the employee’s rating of record on the performance plan of the employee’s permanent position."
This rating of record will include feedback from the detail supervisor as appropriate.
"Exceptions :
Details to IR Positions - A GS or IR employee either competitively or non-competitively detailed to an IR position and who is unratable in the permanent GS or IR position of record (i.e., the employee has not served the minimum appraisal period of 60 days) will be evaluated based on performance in the detail IR position."
The employee's salary will be included in the organization's bonus pool for performance bonuses and special act awards for IR employees in the detail position.
"Details from IR Positions - An employee occupying an IR position who is either competitively or non-competitively detailed to a GS position and who is unratable in the permanent IR position of record (i.e., the employee has not served the minimum appraisal period of 60 days) will be evaluated based on performance in the detail GS position."
The employee will be eligible for a performance award or special act award if the provisions applicable to GS employees covered by that performance appraisal program permit it.
"Since the employee did not receive an IR performance appraisal, the employee's salary will not be included in the bonus pool for performance bonuses and special act awards applicable to the employee's IR position."
"For more information on appraisals for details to or from IR positions, see the Job Aid, Rating Employees on Extended Details, IR to IR, IR to GS, or GS to IR found at http://hco.web.irs.gov/pdf/irjobaidevaldetail.PDF."

Opportunity to Demonstrate Acceptable Performance Per 5 CFR Part 432
(1) When management determines the performance of an employee, as described in IRM 6.432.1.3, Employees Covered, is Unacceptable in one or more CJE(s) or CPE(s), and/or they fail to meet the Retention Standard, the employee’s manager will discuss their performance concerns with the employee and encourage them to improve their performance to at least an acceptable level (Minimally Successful) and/or to meet the Retention Standard to avoid being issued a PIP."
"After this discussion, management will issue a performance counseling memorandum to the employee and file a copy in the employee’s Employee Performance Folder."
Managers also provide oral feedback to assist the employee with improving their performance.
"(2) If the employee’s performance remains Unacceptable and/or they continue to fail to meet the Retention Standard, the manager will meet with the employee and advise them they are being issued a PIP with 60 calendar days to demonstrate at least an acceptable level of performance (Minimally Successful) to prevent a performance-based action."
The PIP period begins with the employee’s receipt of the written PIP letter.
"The PIP is drafted by management’s servicing LRS or the EMU, as appropriate."
"It is reviewed, approved, and issued by the manager with the delegated authority."
"See IRM 6.432.1.4, Delegation of Authority."
"(3) The PIP must contain the following:

The CJE(s) and performance standard(s), or CPE(s), as appropriate, including the Retention Standard, if applicable, the employee is failing to meet."
"The PIP must include specific instances of Unacceptable performance that occurred within the one-year period prior to the date of the PIP;

Advice as to what the employee must do to bring their performance up to an acceptable level (at least Minimally Successful);

A statement that the employee has 60 calendar days, per Article 40 in the National Agreement (as a matter of policy, provision is extended to NBU employees), to bring their performance up to an acceptable level; and

A description of what management will do during the PIP period to assist the employee to improve their Unacceptable performance (e.g., additional training, an on-the-job instructor, weekly meetings)."
Note: A grievance may not be filed on the substance or procedural aspects of the PIP.
"However, if a proposal letter is issued, concerns regarding the PIP may be raised in the oral/written reply and/or in an appeal/grievance after the decision letter is issued."
(4) The opportunity to demonstrate at least an acceptable level of performance may be extended by the manager for up to 60 calendar days.
Management will notify the employee in writing of the extension.
(5) A rating of record will not be assigned to the employee while they are on a PIP.
"The rating of record will be postponed until the PIP expires, and if needed, the manager will advise the employee in writing that their appraisal period is being extended."
"See IRM 6.430.2.4.2.2, Extension of the Appraisal Period, for more information."
"6.432.1.9 (05-15-2023)
Determining Action After Opportunity to Improve
(1) If the employee’s performance improves to Minimally Successful or better, the employee will be notified in writing of their improved performance."
"The letter will also inform the employee that if the employee’s performance becomes Unacceptable in the same CJE(s) or CPE(s), or the Retention Standard at any time during the year after receiving their PIP, an Advance Notice (proposal letter) will be issued to reduce them in grade/pay/payband or remove them without an additional PIP."
"Note: If the employee’s performance becomes Unacceptable in a different CJE, CPE or the Retention Standard, a new PIP must be implemented to address the new CJE, CPE or Retention Standard."
"(2) If the employee’s performance remains Unacceptable, a 30-day Advance Notice of a performance-based action will be issued as soon as possible."
The examples of Unacceptable performance and/or failure to meet the Retention Standard cited in the Advance Notice (proposal letter) must have occurred within the one-year period prior to issuing the Advance Notice (proposal letter).
"Consideration may be given to options other than a reduction in grade/pay/payband or removal, such as:

1) Reassignment to Another Position - a reassignment to the employee’s former position or a similar position at the same grade as the current position."
2) Voluntary Reduction in Grade/Pay/Payband or Reassignment - an employee may acknowledge their inability or unwillingness to fulfill the responsibilities of their position and may voluntarily request a reassignment or downgrade to a lower-graded position.
3) Retirement or Resignation- An employee may advise their manager they are eligible to retire or plan to resign in lieu of an involuntary performance action.
Unreasonable delay in submitting a retirement application or resigning will not prevent management from issuing a performance-based action.
4) Disability Retirement - An employee’s Unacceptable performance may be the result of a mental and/or physical disability.
Unreasonable delay in submitting a disability retirement application will not prevent issuing a performance-based action.
5) Discontinued Service Retirement (DSR) - DSR is a management tool that lessens the impact of an involuntary separation if the employee is not eligible for a voluntary retirement.
"If the separation is against the will and without the consent of the employee, and they are being removed for Unacceptable performance and/or failure to meet the Retention Standard, unrelated to misconduct (which is an action taken under 5 CFR Part 752), DSR may be an option."
"To qualify for DSR, an employee must receive a specific written notice of a proposed involuntary separation (the Advance Notice/proposal letter)."
"See OPM Chapter 44, Discontinued Service Retirement, at https:www.opm.gov/retirement-services/publications-forms/csrsfers-handbook/c044.pdf, for age and length of service requirements."

"See IRM 6.432.1.15, Guidelines for Identifying and Releasing Tax Information for Use in a Personnel Matter."
(3) The Advance Notice is delivered to the employee in person when possible.
"If personal delivery is not possible/appropriate (e.g., the manager would need to travel since the employee is not co-located with them), the Advance Notice is delivered by encrypted e-mail."
"If an employee is on extended leave, consideration should be given to delivering the notice via certified mail and U.S."
Postal mail.
The employee should acknowledge receipt of the notice with their signature and date.
"If the employee refuses to acknowledge receipt, the manager delivering the notice attests to delivering the notice by signing and dating it and includes the following statement: Employee refused to acknowledge receipt; delivered on (date) at (time)."

"(2) Per 5 CFR Section 432.105(a)(4)(i)(B), an agency may extend the Advance Notice period for a period not to exceed 30 days under regulations prescribed by the head of the agency."
"An agency may extend this notice period further without prior OPM approval for the following reasons:

To obtain and/or evaluate medical information when the employee raises a medical condition(s) in their reply to the proposed performance-based action;

To consider the employee's reply if an extension to the reply period is granted (e.g., because of the employee's illness or incapacitation);

Preserves the original performance issue

Results in a record filed in the employee’s OPF, and

"(4) Per The Guide to Processing Personnel Actions, if an employee chooses to resign, retire, or request a change to lower grade,

Before management issues a proposal letter, their SF-50 may not contain a statement referring to their performance issue."

"The letter provides the employee an opportunity to improve and identifies which CJE(s) or CPE(s), as appropriate, and/or the Retention Standard the employee is failing to meet and provides examples of their less than Fully Successful performance."
"(4) If the employee’s performance does not improve to at least Fully Successful, they are issued a notice advising them the WGI is denied."
"The letter is drafted by management’s servicing LRS or the EMU, as appropriate."
"It is reviewed, approved, and issued by the manager with the delegated authority."
"See IRM 6.432.1.4, Delegation of Authority."
"The notice advises them:

of their right to request the designated agency official reconsider the negative determination, per 5 CFR Section 531.410, and

that acceptable level of competence evaluations will continue."
"Per 5 CFR Section 531.411, a new rating of record may be prepared at any time after a WGI is withheld."
The employee’s WGI may be granted if management determines the employee has demonstrated sustained performance at least at the Fully Successful level.
Management may not wait more than 52 weeks from the employee’s original WGI eligibility to make another acceptable level of competence determination.
"For as long as the WGI continues to be denied, a new determination must be made in no more than 52 weeks."
"Note: For BU employees: redacted copies of the notices referenced above are provided simultaneously to the NTEU chapter that represents the employee, per Article 17 of the National Agreement."
Refer to Article 17 for more information on requesting reconsideration of a negative WGI determination.
"(5) If the employee’s performance improves to at least Fully Successful after a negative determination, management inputs the new rating in the automated performance appraisal system and issues the employee a notice advising them of the effective date of their WGI."

Moratoriums on Addressing Performance Matters
(1) Types of moratoriums and the annual holiday moratorium."
"National Emergency - If the president declares a national emergency, such as the Coronavirus Diseases pandemic, the IRS Human Capital Officer will determine if a moratorium on actions related to a performance matter is appropriate and announce the beginning and ending dates."
"Natural Disaster - If the president or other appropriate authority (e.g., city or state official) declares a geographic area as a natural disaster, the business units’ strategic human resource liaisons will collaborate with their servicing labor relations section chief and the Senior Commissioner’s Representative to determine if a moratorium is appropriate and announce the beginning and ending dates."
"Note: Natural disasters are defined as any natural catastrophe (e.g., hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought), or any fire, flood, or explosion, regardless of the cause, in any part of the United States, which the president or city/state official declare is causing damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance to help alleviate the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused by the disaster."
"Depending on the severity of the incident (e.g., explosion, fire), this may include a terrorist attack."
"Winter Holiday Season - Annually for four weeks during the winter holidays, beginning two Mondays before December 25 and ending in January, two Fridays after December 25 (e.g., December 12, 2022, through January 6, 2023)."
(2) What Occurs During a Moratorium - a moratorium does not prohibit all actions.
Management may proceed with certain actions if appropriate.
"When a moratorium is in place, managers continue to work with their servicing LRS or the EMU, as appropriate, to begin addressing a performance matter or continue addressing performance actions already in progress."
"During a moratorium, for employees not serving a probationary/trial period or a temporary/term appointment, managers will consider whether the following activities should be held in abeyance or if they should proceed:

a) Signing/issuing an Advance Notice (proposal letter);
b) Signing/issuing a Final Decision (decision letter);
c) Interviewing/questioning an employee about a performance matter;
d) Issuing grievance replies/decisions;
e) Holding grievance meetings;
f) Holding performance discussions with an employee on a PIP; and
g) Oral replies."
"6.432.1.21 (05-15-2023)

"(2) If management determines a performance-based action was taken erroneously, they may take corrective action, even if an appeal/complaint has been filed about the matter."
(3) Management must ensure it removes only the information they determine to be inaccurate or to reflect an action taken illegally or in error.
"6.432.1.22 (05-15-2023)
Legal Findings and Orders
(1) Management may unilaterally act on a finding of discrimination or implement an EEO, MSPB, arbitrator, or other third-party order."
"(2) Management and their servicing LRS or the EMU, as appropriate, must coordinate these actions with Chief Counsel’s Labor & Personnel Law Branch and/or Equity, Diversity & Inclusion, as appropriate."
"6.432.1.23 (05-15-2023)
Records Retention
(1) In compliance with Document 12829, General Records Schedules (see 2.3, Employee Relations Records), LERN retains performance case files for six years."
"Note: All records and documentation (e-mail, electronic documents, system printouts, etc.)"
"relevant to the performance case must be retained until all appeal periods have expired, which may be longer than the six-year period."
"(2) Per 5 CFR Section 432.107(b), if the employee is not reduced in grade/pay/payband or removed because their performance improved and their performance continues to be acceptable for one year from the date of the Advance Notice (proposal letter), any entry or other notation of the Unacceptable Performance for which the action was proposed shall be removed from any agency record relating to the employee."
(3) The SF-50 for the performance-based action is a permanent record file in the employee’s OPF.

"General information on federal award programs may be found at OPM’s Performance Management Cycle site under the Rewarding tab, which does not supplement this chapter."
"6.451.1.2 (04-04-2024)
Basis for Formal Recognition
At management discretion, awards may be granted to an IRS employee based on:
Performance as reflected in the employee's properly recorded rating of record, or
A special act or service in the public interest relating to or related to official employment, and/or
A superior accomplishment, productivity gain, or other personal effort that contributes to the efficiency, economy or other improvement of government operations or achieves a significant reduction in work."
"6.451.1.3 (04-04-2024)
Documenting Awards
Monetary and time-off awards may be initiated, approved, certified, and authorized in an automated human resources (HR) system."

"Form 9127, Recommendation for Recognition, is required as documentation in the Special Act and Manager Awards process."
"Form 9127 or documentation that contains the same information as Form 9127, both approved and disapproved, must be retained in the EPF for a minimum of two years."

"6.451.1.4 (04-04-2024)
Coverage
This guidance applies to all bargaining unit (BU) and non-bargaining (NBU) employees."
"Unless otherwise noted, the provisions of this IRM are applicable to all IRS employees, including reemployed annuitant and phased retirement employees, except:
Employees of the Office of Chief Counsel
Presidential Appointees
Members of the Senior Executive Service (SES)
Critical Pay Executives
Schedule C Appointees
Executive and other high-level IRS officials
Employees of other federal agencies may be granted awards for contributions that benefit the IRS and meet its awards criteria."

This also applies to former members of the armed forces.
"Other persons and organizations not described in paragraphs (1) through (4) above, including volunteers, employees of private contractors and private organizations may not be granted awards under the authorities cited in IRM 6.451.1.1.2, Authority."
The prohibition regarding contract employees includes those who may work side-by-side with IRS employees as members of the same overall work teams.
"The pay, awards and discipline of a contract employee is handled by their employer (the contractor), not the IRS."
"These persons and organizations may be presented unframed Informal Awards Certificates to recognize significant, non-routine, contributions to the IRS such as volunteer service performed on behalf of the IRS through activities such as the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance and Tax Counseling for the Elderly programs."
"6.451.1.5 (09-02-2025)
Funding Awards
Award funding for BU employees is negotiated by IRS and the National Treasury Employee’s Union (NTEU)."
Award funding for NBU employees will mirror that of BU employees with regard to the percentage used to calculate overall funding level.
"When a monetary award is approved for an employee of another federal agency, arrangements should be made to transfer funds to the employing agency."
"If the administrative costs of transferring funds would exceed the amount of the award, the employing agency should absorb the award costs."
"For example, it would not be practical to transfer funds when an award is $200 or less."
"When another agency approves an award for an IRS employee, arrangements should be made to transfer funds in the same manner."
The Division Finance Officer should be contacted to coordinate the transfer of funds from the former agency.
"Refer to 5 CFR 451.104, Awards, for additional information."
"6.451.1.6 (04-04-2024)

The IRS will not grant awards or high-level recognition to non-SES employees when it is deemed necessary to protect the integrity of the IRS."
The 2022 National Agreement (NA) provides specific information on how screening results for both misconduct and tax compliance will be handled for BU employees.
"As a matter of policy, the NA screening provision also applies to NBU employees."
"Refer to the 2025 Addendum to the 2022 National Agreement, Article 18, Section 1.D, at Document 11678-B."
"6.451.1.6.2 (04-04-2024)
Misconduct and Tax Compliance Screening
Business unit points of contact (POC) serve as liaisons between the business unit and the Labor/Employee Relations and Negotiation (LERN) office for the misconduct screening process."
"All covered awards and recognition described in IRM 6.451.1.6.3, Covered Awards and Recognition, will be screened for misconduct per the Awards Misconduct Screening and Case Process at Awards Misconduct Screening and Case Process SOP [Standard Operating Procedure], as well as for federal tax compliance prior to initiating any type of covered awards or recognition."
"The applicable period for review will be the 12-month period, or relevant performance year as appropriate, prior to the effective date for the type of award under consideration."
"6.451.1.6.3 (04-04-2024)
Covered Awards and Recognition
The following types of awards and recognition are covered by the misconduct and federal tax compliance screenings:
QSIs
Performance Awards/Bonuses (monetary and time-off)
Performance Based Increases (PBIs) for supervisors under the IRS Payband System (IR)
Special Act / Manager Awards (monetary and time-off)
Bilingual Awards (monetary and time-off)
Foreign Language Awards
Retention, Relocation, Recruitment and Extended Assignment Incentives

External awards, such as Service to America Medal Awards, Federal Employee of the Year Awards, Flemming Awards, etc."
"Employee Referral Bonuses
Travel Gainsharing Awards
6.451.1.7 (04-04-2024)
Performance Awards/Bonuses
Performance awards/bonuses may be granted only to individual employees either as monetary or time off awards."
"Refer to IRM 6.451.1.12, Time-Off Awards (TOA) (General Provisions), for applicable TOA provisions."
"When granted, these awards must be based on an employee's performance as reflected in the employee’s rating of record for the fiscal year (FY) for which awards are being processed, provided that the rating is at the Fully Successful or Met level or above."
The employee’s officially approved rating of record provides sufficient basis and justification for granting a performance award/bonus.
"Programs for granting performance awards/bonuses as designed and applied, must make meaningful distinctions based on levels of performance."
This means that employees with higher ratings of record within the same awards grouping must receive larger performance awards than those with lower ratings of record.
"Under IRS policy, an employee who is granted a QSI is not eligible for a performance award for the same rating period."
Note: Not all performance appraisals are ratings of record.
"Refer to IRM 6.430.1, Introduction to Performance Management."
Employees may receive one performance award/bonus for each properly recorded rating of record.
"Example: An employee receives a Form 6850-BU rating of record for period ending 03/31/2023, then receives a promotion to a management official position on 07/16/2023."
"Since the employee will have at least 60 ratable days in the management official position on 09/30/2023, they will receive a Form 12450-B (NBU) rating of record for that rating period."
This results in the employee having two ratings of record for separate rating periods under different performance agreements in the same FY.
The BU award is required if the employee meets all the eligibility criteria.
"If the business unit also wants to recognize the NBU rating of record and the employee meets all the NBU performance award eligibility criteria, the NBU performance award may be paid as well."
"Note: Employees may not receive any portion of any bonus or award payment in any calendar year, which when combined with the employee’s basic pay, would cause the employee’s aggregate compensation (including premium pay) to exceed the rate of level I of the Executive Schedule at the end of the calendar year."
"Refer to IRM 6.530.1, Aggregate Limitation on Pay and Special Rate Schedules, for details."
"6.451.1.7.1 (04-04-2024)
Performance Award/Bonus Monetary Limitation
5 USC 4505a(a)(2), provides that a monetary performance award/bonus shall not be more than 10% of the employee’s annual rate of basic pay, which must include: any applicable locality-based comparability payments under 5 CFR 531, Subpart F; special rate schedules for recruitment and retention under 5 CFR 530, Subpart C (special salary rate schedules); or similar payment or supplement under other legal authority."
"For an employee receiving a pay retention under 5 CFR 536, Subpart C (or similar authority, such as 5 CFR 359.705), the rate of basic pay is the maximum payable rate for the employee’s grade or level, rather than the retained rate."
"As an exception to the 10% limitation, a performance award/bonus of not more than 20% of the employee's annual rate of basic pay may be approved by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue for exceptional performance."
"Requests for exception to the 10% limitation for NBU employees is covered by this IRM (refer to IRM 6.451.1.4, Coverage)."
"Coverage should be forwarded to the business unit awards coordinator, through the Director, Policy Office to the Deputy Commissioner for approval."
Performance award/bonus certificates are provided electronically or printed and distributed by the supervisor of record via the self-service offering on the Human Capital website.
"For more information, refer to the Awards Certificates at Formal Awards Certificates."
"6.451.1.7.2 (04-04-2024)
Performance Award/Bonus Eligibility for Separated Employees
Employees who leave the IRS may be eligible to receive a performance award/bonus for their final rating of record if they met the performance award/bonus criteria associated with their performance plan:
BU and NBU-Other employees on Form 6850-performance plans who meet the eligibility criteria are eligible for consideration to receive a performance award."
"The employee must have completed the appraisal period, received a rating of record for the current FY, and be in a permanent BU or NBU-Other position as of the last day of the last pay period that ends on or before June 30 preceding the awards payment date for the rating period being recognized."
"For a BU performance award, BU employees must be on the rolls in a BU position and have 12 continuous months on the rolls as of the last day of the last pay period ending on or before June 30."
Management officials on Form 12450-performance agreements who meet the eligibility criteria are eligible for consideration to receive a performance award.
The employee must have received a rating of record for the current FY and be on the rolls in a management official position on September 30 of the rating period being recognized.
Supervisors covered under the IRS Payband (IR) system on Form 12450-A performance agreements who meet the eligibility criteria are eligible for consideration to receive a performance bonus.
The supervisor must have received an IR rating of record for the current FY and be in an IR position on September 30 of the rating period being recognized.
"6.451.1.8 (04-04-2024)
Performance Awards - Bargaining Unit (BU)
BU employees' performance award eligibility and amounts are determined per the 2025 Addendum to the 2022 NA, the 2022 NA, the National Performance Award Agreement (NPAA), and other negotiated provisions."
Refer to the HCO Performance Awards site for program information.
"Under the 2025 Addendum to the 2022 NA, Article 18, BU employees who perform work at a grade higher than specified in their official position descriptions during a rating period may be eligible for increased performance awards."
Refer to the HCO Performance Awards site at Performance Awards site for information on eligibility requirements and procedures.
"6.451.1.9 (04-04-2024)
Performance Awards - Non-Bargaining Unit (NBU)
Under the provisions of this IRM, NBU employees may be granted performance awards/bonuses."
"This includes non-supervisory NBU management officials, NBU-Other employees and supervisors (IR)."
Management Officials on Form 12450-Performance Agreements - Ratings are based on commitments and responsibilities.
"Management shall review each ""Exceeded"" appraisal to determine eligibility for an award."
"This shall include a review of the overall performance and commitments, obstacles overcome to exceed and complexity of the commitment."
NBU Employees on Form 6850-Performance Plans (NBU Other) - Ratings are based on Critical Job Element (CJE) scores.
A cut-off score will be established to determine the number of employees who received an exceeds rating who will be granted performance awards.
Business units should establish their rating cutoff scores in July of each year.
Supervisors (IR) on Form 12450A Performance Agreements - Ratings are based on commitments and responsibilities.
"The Performance Review Board (PRB) reviews the summary evaluation ratings of all supervisors on a corporate basis, within their business unit, to ensure performance rating consistency and objectivity."
"For additional PRB guidance, refer to the Payband Resource Center site."
Additional information on NBU performance awards/bonuses can be found on the HCO Performance Awards site.
"6.451.1.9.1 (04-04-2024)
Eligibility - NBU Performance Awards/Bonuses
The IRS will grant performance awards/bonuses to NBU employees who are assigned Outstanding performance ratings of record."
"The IRS will grant performance bonuses to supervisors (IR) who are assigned an Exceeded rating of record, who exceed in both their responsibilities and their commitments."
Supervisors (IR) who are assigned an Exceeded rating of record but do not exceed both their responsibilities and commitments will not receive a performance bonus.
There will be no exceptions.
Non-supervisory employees who are assigned Exceeds performance ratings of record may be provided performance awards at management discretion.
Performance bonuses will not be provided for supervisors (IR) with a Met rating of record.
There will be no exceptions.
A rating of record for the current FY is required for the employee to be eligible to receive a performance award/bonus.
"Employees occupying an NBU position on the NBU award cut-off date may receive an NBU performance award/bonus if all other NBU award/bonus criteria are met, including those established by the business unit."
"The award/bonus cut-off dates are:
The last day of the pay period on or before June 30 preceding the awards payment date for the rating period being recognized if rated on a Form 6850 performance plan."
September 30 for management officials on a Form 12450B/D-performance agreement.
"September 30 for supervisors (IR) on Form 12450A-performance agreement except for the following individuals who will be included in the performance bonus pool and are eligible for a performance bonus:
1."
"Permanent supervisors (IR) who are permanently moved out of an IR position and into a non-IR position within the last 60 calendar days of the appraisal period (where the departure appraisal becomes the rating of record);

2."
"General Schedule (GS) employees on a temporary assignment to an IR position who receive an IR annual rating of record are not eligible for, and can not receive, an annual rating of record in their permanent GS position for the current performance award/bonus payout cycle."
"They are not eligible for the following reasons:

Did not have 60 calendar days of performance in the permanent GS position,
Had at least 60 calendar days of performance in the temporary IR position under an established IR performance plan, and
Left the temporary assignment within 60 calendar days prior to September 30 (the end of the IR annual rating period)."
Eligibility requires the candidate be an IRS employee and assigned to a “permanent” NBU position.
"The word permanent refers to the position of record, not the appointment type."
"The requirement is based on the employee’s permanent position of record as recorded in the Treasury Integrated Management Information System (TIMIS), not a temporary assignment to another position, such as a detail or temporary promotion of less than 365 days."
Refer to exception below.
Awards/bonuses will be funded and processed by the business unit the employee is permanently assigned to on the applicable cut-off date.
"Example: Employee A in the Large Business and International Division, GS-7, rated on Form 6850-BU for period ending 02/28/2023, received a permanent promotion to GS-9 in the Small Business/Self Employed Division (SBSE) on 03/12/2023."
The cut-off date for employees rated on Form 6850-BU for FY23 ratings was 06/17/2023.
The employee’s award was funded and processed by the SBSE Division.
"Exception: Employees on temporary promotions with a not-to-exceed date equal to or greater than 365 days, who are not ratable in their position of record, are rated in the temporary position and are eligible for an award/bonus from the pool they were rated under (Form 6850-NBU or Form 12450-A/B/D)."
"In this instance, the business unit in which the employee was rated will fund and process the applicable award."
Note: This only applies to temporary promotions and does not apply to detail actions.
"An employee who is on a detail is considered, for pay and organizational purposes to be occupying their permanent position of record."
"See IRM 6.430.5, Performance Appraisals for Temporary Assignments, for information about how to address details and temporary promotions."
"6.451.1.9.2 (04-04-2024)
Award/Bonus Structure - NBU Performance Awards/Bonuses
Performance award/bonus calculation methods:
Determined as a percentage of an individual’s salary or share value (including locality pay) as of September 30 for supervisors (IR) and management officials on Form 12450-performance agreements."
"Applicable percent bonus ranges will be posted annually on the payband resource center or supervisors (IR) performance bonuses, and on the HCO Performance Awards site at Performance Awards for non-supervisory NBU employees."
Determined as a percentage of individual salary or share value (including locality pay) as of the last day of the pay period on or before June 30 for NBU-Other employees on a Form 6850-performance plan.
"The eligibility criteria beyond the scope of this IRM, determination of the award/bonus amount, and the calculation method will be at the discretion of each business unit."
"All criteria used to determine the distribution of performance awards/bonuses must be documented in each business units’ NBU Award/Bonus Plan, provided to the Policy Office by November 30 each year, and posted or made readily available to employees, if requested."
"6.451.1.9.3 (04-04-2024)
Additional Factors - NBU Performance Awards/Bonuses
A non-supervisory employee is not eligible to receive a QSI and a performance award for the same rating period."
"If the IRS determines the value for a performance award/bonus as a percentage of salary, the performance award/bonus must be based on the employee's rate of basic pay per 5 CFR 531, Subpart B."
Performance awards/bonuses must make meaningful distinctions based on levels of performance.
This means employees with higher ratings of record must receive larger performance awards (either as a dollar amount or as a percentage of salary) than those with lower ratings of record.
"For supervisors (IR), the business unit may divide and/or distribute an IR performance bonus percentage in any fraction within the approved range, provided the percentage awarded, not the dollar amount, for any Outstanding rating is greater than the percentage awarded for any Exceeded rating within the same payband."
Performance bonuses will not be provided for supervisors (IR) with a Met rating of record; there will be no exceptions.
Granting of QSIs for NBU-Other and management officials are at management discretion following the QSI Policy Guidance and must adhere to all funding levels set forth by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO).
"Once all NBU performance awards/bonuses have been paid, if there are any funds remaining, the business unit has the option of using those funds for discretionary awards."
"If excess performance award/bonus funds are realigned to pay NBU discretionary awards, the decision must be documented."
"6.451.1.9.4 (04-04-2024)
Review Process - NBU Performance Awards/Bonuses
Annually, each business unit must review the awards pool to determine the eligibility for granting awards/bonuses."
Each business unit is responsible for establishing the number of Exceeds or Exceeds Fully Successful for non-supervisory employees who are eligible to receive awards based on objective criteria.
"For management officials, the determination will be made based on reviewing the complexity of their commitments on Form 12450-B/D performance agreement."
"For NBU-Others, on Form 6850 performance plans, the determination will be based on a cut-off score."
Each business unit shall document all monetary and TOAs in compliance with OPM guidelines.
Each business unit will identify a POC for awards/bonuses referred to as award coordinators.
"6.451.1.10 (09-02-2025)
Quality Step Increases
A QSI is a faster than normal increase in an employee's rate of basic pay (includes locality or special rate) from one step of an employee's GS or General Scheduled Law Enforcement Officers (GL) grade to the next higher step of that grade."
A QSI has the effect of moving an employee through the GS or GL pay range faster than by periodic step increases alone.
"5 CFR 531, Subpart E, outlines provisions for QSI eligibility requirements, which have been incorporated into the IRM 6.451.1.10.1, QSI Eligibility."
The purpose of a QSI is to provide appropriate incentives and recognition for excellence in performance.
"As with other types of recognition, QSI nominations and selections will be based on merit factors, with review of employees' significant accomplishments during the rating period."
"QSIs can provide long-term salary increases, and organizations must consider budgetary impact when deciding on the number of QSIs to approve each FY."
"Additionally, the maximum number of QSIs that an agency may approve may be subject to limitations established by the Office of Management and Budget and OPM."
"When granting QSIs, business units must use the annualized cost of the QSIs to ensure they remain within their spending allocations."
"With regard to NBU employees whose performance is rated on CJEs, business units have the discretion of effecting QSIs on the same cycle as that used for BU employees (see the 2025 Addendum to the 2022 NA, Document 11678-B, Exhibit 18-1) or in the first quarter of the fiscal year following the rating cycle being recognized."
This decision must be documented in the business unit’s NBU Performance Award Plan.
Non-managerial NBU employees whose performance is rated against responsibilities and commitments / objectives will have their QSIs processed in the first quarter of the FY following the rating of record being recognized.
"6.451.1.10.1 (04-04-2024)
QSI Eligibility
All GS and GL employees described under the QSI Eligibility criteria are covered."
"The IRS QSI eligibility criteria shall be based on official personnel records, rating of record approved by management and validly processed in the approved performance management system and other information available to supervisors."
"Per regulatory requirements, supervisors may recommend/nominate IRS employees for QSIs who meet eligibility requirements."
"To be eligible for a QSI, employees must:
Be below step 10 of their grade level,
Have been officially assigned a current Outstanding rating of record,
Have not been granted a QSI within the preceding 52 consecutive calendar weeks and,
Occupy a permanent position."
Note: An employee serving on a temporary appointment is not eligible for a QSI.
“Permanent position” means a position filled by an employee whose appointment is not designated as temporary and does not have a definite time limitation of one year or less.
"6.451.1.10.2 (04-04-2024)
QSI Nominating Processing Procedures
Supervisors may nominate employees for QSIs at their discretion per the criteria in IRM 6.451.1.10.1, QSI Eligibility, and business unit timelines and procedures."
"Supervisors will submit nominations using Form 14776, QSI Nomination, and must include a justification regarding the outstanding accomplishments that warrant the granting of a QSI."
"Each business unit will ensure that all ratings of record are timely completed, approved and validly entered into the approved performance management system within the deadlines described in the IRM 6.430 Performance Management series and the NA."
"For BU and NBU-Other employees, business units must ensure that all ratings of record are completed and input as Rating Reviewed/Approved Status, in the automated performance appraisal system no later than June 30 of each year to ensure all QSI eligible employees are considered for nomination."
"For management officials and management/program analysts (for positions designated as confidential only), business units must ensure that all ratings of record are completed and input as Rating Reviewed/Approved Status, in the automated HR system, no later than October 31 of each year to ensure all QSI eligible employees are considered for nomination."
"If the business unit has a Commitment Review Board, the deadline is November 30."
Each business unit will develop and issue nomination timelines and procedures to their supervisors to ensure QSI nominations and selections are timely completed.
Business units will not develop any additional QSI nomination criteria.
"Each business unit will determine the approving official(s) for QSIs within their respective divisions in compliance with Delegation Order 6-22 at IRM 1.2.2.7.12.
Business units may not exceed the QSI funding levels provided by the CFO."
Employees will be given five business days to decide whether to accept the QSI offer.
Supervisors will need to adjust these timeframes for employees on approved leave.
Business units will make reasonable attempts to facilitate a timely response.
"If no response is received, the form will be documented as “no response, QSI not accepted” and the employee will not be granted a QSI."
"For employees in non-work or furlough status, supervisors will forward the Form 14776, QSI Nomination, to their home address via US Mail and allow 10 business days for a response."
"Employees who decline QSIs will remain eligible for performance awards, provided all other performance award requirements are met."
Each business unit must determine which employees will receive a QSI no later than eight weeks prior to the effective date for the annual IRS-NTEU performance award payments or timeframe indicated in IRS guidance.
The QSI final approval will be completed by the IRS Human Capital Officer or their designee.
The HCO Performance Management and Recognition (PMR) office will communicate QSI effective dates annually in coordination with the annual performance award payouts.
QSI effective dates for NBU-Other employees evaluated on Form 6850 typically will be one pay period prior to the annual performance awards effective date.
"QSI effective dates for BU employees, evaluated on Form 6850, typically will be within the first quarter of the FY."
"QSI effective dates for management officials, evaluated on Form 12450-B/D, will be one pay period after the annual performance awards effective date."
(This is due to the rating period ending September 30 and to allow business units ample time to make the QSI selections.)
Each business unit will be responsible for the timely input of QSI PARs for all BU and NBU employees.
The PAR actions must be input into the automated HR system at least two full pay periods prior to the effective date.
"If not, the date of the PAR action will be changed to the following pay period."
"The narrative justification used on Form 14776, QSI Nomination, for granting the QSI must be included in the remarks section of the PAR, along with the rating period covered and date the misconduct/tax compliance screenings were complete."
"Refer to the SOP 451-1, Processing Awards in HRConnect, at Standard Operating Procedures, HR Shared Services SOPs."
"6.451.1.10.3 (04-04-2024)
QSI Additional Factors
Once a QSI election is confirmed and accepted by the employee, it cannot and will not be rescinded."
"A QSI does not affect the timing of an employee’s next regular Within-Grade Increase (WGI), unless the QSI places the employee in step 4 or step 7 of their grade."
"In these cases, the employee must complete the full waiting period for the new step 104 weeks for steps 4-6, or 156 weeks for steps 7-9."
"However, the time an employee has already waited is not lost; it continues to count towards the waiting period for the next step increase."
The QSI provides the employee the benefit of receiving an additional step increase at an earlier date than they originally would have without losing any time creditable towards their next WGI.
Employees at step 9 should consider the effective date of their next WGI to a step 10 and whether a QSI is advantageous.
The example below provides greater detail in determining the benefit of a QSI for employees at the step 9.
"For employees at the step 9, who are due a WGI between January and September of the calendar year, electing a QSI will not provide the benefit of the QSI because the employee’s step would be a step 10 when the QSI becomes effective."
QSIs are generally awarded in the first quarter (between October and December) of the FY following the rating of record.
The table below illustrates the point that the employee will already have achieved step 10 by the time the QSI is processed.
"Current Step	9
Due Date of Next WGI	September 22, 2023
QSI Election Made:	July 3, 2023
QSI Effective Date:	October 22, 2023
This example shows that the employee’s WGI would be received on the due date of September 22, 2023; therefore, the QSI would not be granted since the employee would be at step 10 on the QSI effective date of October 22, 2023."
"Further details are available on Form 14776, QSI Nomination."
"6.451.1.10.4 (04-04-2024)
Effects of Promotions
A QSI must be applied to the rate of pay for the position on which the rating of record was based."
"If an employee receives a career ladder promotion or competitive promotion after their rating of record is issued but before the effective date of said QSI, the employee will lose eligibility for the QSI."
"However, the employee retains eligibility for a performance award."
"If the rating of record is based on the employee’s performance in the temporary promotion, the QSI must be based on the rate of pay for the temporary position."
"When the temporary promotion terminates, the employee loses the benefit of the QSI because pay is set at the lower grade as if the employee had not been temporarily promoted (refer to IRM 6.531.1.2.11, Setting Pay upon Demotion (Change to Lower Grade/Band))."
"The employee may receive the benefit of the QSI upon re-promotion provided the temporary promotion is held for over 365 days (refer to IRM 6.531.1.2.15, Rates of Basic Pay that May be Used as the Highest Previous Rate)."
"In this situation, employees should weigh the benefits of the QSI in the temporary position and the impact the QSI will have when moving back down to the lower grade of their prior position."
"If the rating of record was based on the employee’s performance in the permanent position, the QSI cannot be awarded based on the rate of pay received during a temporary promotion."
The employee would be eligible to be granted the QSI after termination of the temporary promotion when the employee returns to the lower-graded position.
This is an exception to the IRS policy of effecting all QSIs on the same date.
"If an employee is approved for a QSI on their position of record and a temporary promotion becomes permanent, the QSI cannot be granted in the higher-graded position to which the employee was promoted (e.g., if a QSI is approved based on outstanding performance at the GS-9, the QSI cannot be granted at the GS-11)."
"However, the employee retains eligibility for a performance award."
"If an employee is approved for a QSI on their position of record and becomes eligible for a career ladder promotion while on the temporary promotion, or if a competitive permanent promotion is effective prior to the effective date of the QSI, the QSI cannot be granted."
"However, the employee retains eligibility for a performance award."
"In all cases, a QSI must be effective prior to the employee’s receipt of a subsequent rating of record."
"If the QSI is not processed due to a temporary promotion and a subsequent rating of record is issued before the employee returns to their position of record, they lose eligibility for the QSI."
"In these cases, the employee retains eligibility for a performance award."
"6.451.1.10.5 (04-04-2024)
QSI Documentation and Review
All documentation for those selected and offered QSIs must be forwarded to the employees’ immediate supervisor for filing in the EPF."
"Documentation includes the final Form 14776, QSI Nomination, which must include the QSI offer and employee response."
"Business unit QSI Coordinators will maintain records of the nomination and selection process, including names of all nominations, selections, misconduct screening, offer letters, and Personnel Action Request (PARs)."
"After QSIs have been made effective, business units and HCO will review QSI distribution patterns."
"6.451.1.10.6 (04-04-2024)
Retroactive Limitation
In accordance with decisions of the Government Accountability Office, a QSI may not be granted retroactively."
This means that a QSI may not be made effective before the date it was approved by the authorized official (the IRS Human Capital Officer or their designee).
"However, delays beyond normal processing cycle due to human or computer error may constitute an administrative error, which is grounds for processing the QSI retroactively."
The business unit must have completed the QSI Nomination Process within the annual timeframe issued by the HCO PMR office and obtained the business unit approval signatures prior to this cut-off date to satisfy this exception.
"6.451.1.11 (04-04-2024)
Special Act and Manager Awards
Special Act/Manager Awards are types of discretionary awards."
"Refer to IRM 6.451.1.1.6, Terms."
Only one award (cash or time-off) is allowed for any one contribution.
Streamlined approval and processing procedures maybe employed during national emergencies.
Award Certificates are available for presentation with any of the Special Act and Manager Awards.
"6.451.1.11.1 (09-02-2025)
Monetary Special Act and Manager Awards
The business units will allocate a percentage of their BU and NBU performance award budgets to fund monetary Special Act/Manager Awards."
"The percentage to be set aside for BU awards is specified in Article 18, Section 1(B)(3), of the 2025 Addendum to the 2022 NA."
Funding allocations for NBU monetary Special Act and Manager Awards will be established as a minimum of 10% of the NBU performance award allocation.
Increases in this allocation may be made at the discretion of each business unit and must be documented in the business unit’s annual NBU Performance Award Plan.
Each business unit will develop internal procedures for their supervisors to ensure award nominations are reviewed against the Special Act/Manager allocations prior to approval and processing.
There is no limit to the number of monetary Special Act/Manager awards an employee may receive for their accomplishments either as an individual or a member of a group or team.
Written justification is required for each monetary Special Act/Manager award and requires approval as outlined in Delegation Order 6-22 at IRM 1.2.2.7.12.
"For additional guidance, refer to Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) 451-1, Processing Awards in HRConnect at Standard Operating Procedures, HR Shared Services SOPs."
Guidance on determining the amount of a Monetary Special Act/Manager award is provided in Form 9127.
"6.451.1.11.2 (09-02-2025)
Time-Off Special Act/Manager Awards
Time-Off Special Act/Manager awards are granted in the form of time-off afforded to employees assigned to a BU or NBU position and are granted under guidance by 5 CFR 451.104 (a) and Article 18, Sections 4 and 5 of the 2025 Addendum to the 2022 NA."
"Time-Off Special Act/Manager awards granted under these provisions are not charged to the awards or bonus budgets; however, the value of these awards is limited to a maximum percentage of the business unit’s performance award budget."
Business units may utilize any amount up to the designated limitation to ensure organizational needs are met.
The designated percentage will be determined corporately on an annual basis and published on the HCO Performance Awards site.
Each business unit will develop internal procedures for their supervisors to ensure award nominations are reviewed against the defined limitation prior to approval and processing.
Conversion of a time-off Special Act/Manager Award to a monetary award is prohibited.
"5 CFR 451.104 (f) states, “A Time-Off Award granted under this subpart shall not be converted to a cash payment under any circumstances.”
Exception: If a time-off award is granted in error and the error can be documented, correction of the error by reversing the time off award and granting a monetary award is not a prohibited conversion described in the regulation."
These corrections will be limited to cases that are fully documented.
"BU employees who were issued a leave restriction letter within 12 months before the award effective date are not eligible for a time-off Special Act/Manager Award under this policy, per Article 18, Section 5D of the 2025 Addendum to the 2022 NA."
This provision does not apply to NBU employees.
Supervisors nominating an employee for a time-off Special Act/Manager Award must complete Form 9127 and include written justification describing the employee accomplishment that is the basis for the time-off Special Act/Manager Award.
This form must be maintained in the employee’s EPF.
Time-Off amounts are limited to a minimum of one hour requiring management approval.
Note: Please refer to the frequently asked questions (FAQs) on the HCO Performance Awards site for additional information regarding time-off Special Act and time-off Manager Awards.
"6.451.1.12 (04-04-2024)
Time Off Awards (TOA) (General Provisions)
This section provides general provisions for all types of TOAs under this IRM."
Not more than 40 hours of time-off may be granted to any full-time employee for any single contribution during a leave year.
"(A part-time employee, or an employee with an uncommon tour of duty, may be granted hours not to exceed one-half of the average number of hours in the biweekly scheduled tour of duty.)"
No more than a combined total of 80 hours of time-off may be granted to any full-time employee during a leave year including a TOA in lieu of a monetary performance award/bonus or bilingual award.
"(A part-time employee, or an employee with an uncommon tour of duty may be granted a total number of hours not to exceed the average number of hours in the biweekly scheduled tour of duty)."
Supervisors are responsible for ensuring an employee has not reached the 80-hour TOA limit in a calendar year.
"This includes all TOAs (e.g., in lieu of monetary performance, bilingual)."
This can be done by reviewing the leave balances displayed in the payroll system or through the IRS Human Resources Reporting Center at HRRC via the Secured Business Unit Reports tab.
"Note: Refer to IRM 6.451.1.12.2, Calculating Time-Off and Supplemental Monetary Awards, for procedures applicable when a TOA would exceed the 40- or 80-hour limitation."
"Time-off shall not be used:
To reduce an outstanding leave deficit such as advanced sick leave,
As a substitute for other personnel or pay actions, or
In lieu of payment for overtime worked."
"6.451.1.12.1 (09-02-2025)
Scheduling and Taking Time Off
Employees are responsible for obtaining their supervisor’s approval for the use of time-off hours in the same manner as all leave approval requests."
Employees may not use the TOA until it is posted in Single Entry Time Reporting (SETR).
"Once available, time-off may be taken in a single block of time or in one-hour increments."
"The granting of time-off does not increase an employee’s “use or lose” annual leave, and time-off should be scheduled so as not to conflict with existing “use or lose” annual leave."
Time-off absence is not justification for the restoration of forfeited annual leave.
"Because time-off is not annual leave, it cannot be transferred to another federal employee under the Voluntary Leave Transfer Program."
Time-off balances will be forfeited if there is a balance at the time of separation.
Time-off must be scheduled and taken within one year after the effective date of the award unless one of the exceptions in this paragraph applies.
"Time-off that is not taken within one year (26 pay periods) and not subject to one of the exceptions below, will be forfeited and will not be restored."
"The second-level supervisor may grant a written exception prior to expiration in the following situations:
When an employee is granted extended annual or sick leave or leave without pay that would prevent taking the time-off within one year,
When a BU employee is issued a leave restriction letter after the TOA approval, which would prevent taking the time-off within one year (this provision does not apply to NBU employees.)"
Note: This may occur if the employee requests TOA hours due to illness or injury but fails to provide acceptable medical documentation.
"When physical incapacitation for duty occurs during a period when an employee is taking time-off, sick leave may be granted for the period of incapacitation (medical certification may be required upon the employee’s return to work)."
"Time-off should then be rescheduled, subject to the supervisor’s approval,
If military service requiring military leave, military leave without pay, annual leave, or sick leave is approved and used."
"In this situation, leave granted for military service after the effective date of the TOA and before the employee returns to duty with the IRS, shall extend the one-year time limitation based on an eight-hour workday."
"For example, if a total of 200 hours of this type of leave was approved and used for military service, the one-year limitation shall be extended by five calendar weeks, or
Note: If the employee provides the immediate supervisor with a copy of the military orders directing the employee to active duty or appointed into Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) service to respond to disasters and emergencies and a copy of the certificate on completion of such duty."
This information should be provided to the supervisor upon the employee’s return to duty with IRS and before expiration of the extended period.
Higher level approval is not required for this exception.
The supervisor shall contact their payroll representative promptly to have the expiration date of the TOA extended.
"In the event of a regional or national emergency, as determined by management, which prevents the employee from taking the time off within one year."
"For example, an employee disapproved for use of time off due to critical IRS need in response to national disaster/pandemic."
"6.451.1.12.2 (09-02-2025)
Calculating Time Off and Supplemental Awards
When time-off is approved as an award, the time-off hours shall be calculated as follows:
The value of the TOA is divided by the employee’s hourly rate of pay, rounded to the nearest dollar."
The result is rounded to the nearest hour.
"Example: If the recommended award amount is $500, and an employee earns $15.72 an hour, the $500 award amount is divided by $16; (the $15.72 hourly rate of pay, rounded to the nearest dollar)."
The result of 31.25 hours is rounded to a 31-hour TOA.
"If the value of the TOA is divided by the employee’s hourly rate of pay and exceeds the 40-hour limitation, the balance of the award will be paid as a monetary award."
"For example, if the recommended award amount is $800 and an employee earns $15.72 an hour, the $800, award is divided by $16 (the $15.72 hourly rate of pay, rounded to the nearest dollar)."
"The result of 50 hours exceeds the 40-hour limitation; therefore, the employee would receive a 40-hour TOA, and the balance of $160 would be issued as a monetary award."
"For calculating time-off, the hourly rate of pay is determined by the employee’s basic annual salary on the date the award is approved."
"The annual rate of basic pay used must include any applicable locality-based comparability payments 5 CFR 531, Subpart F, special rate schedules for recruitment and retention, 5 CFR 530, Subpart C, or similar payment or supplement under other legal authority."
"For an employee receiving pay retention, 5 CFR 536, Subpart C (or similar authority, such as 5 CFR 359.705), pay, the rate of basic pay is the maximum payable rate for the employee’s grade or level, rather than the retained rate."
"Hourly rates of locality pay for employees paid under the GS are posted on the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM’s) page, Salaries & Wages."
Hourly rates for employees paid under the IRS Payband System are posted on the Payband Resource Center.
Supplemental Monetary Awards.
"If the time-off component of a performance award (calculated as described in paragraph 2) results in hours that exceed the 40- or 80- hour limitation described in IRM 6.451.1.12.1, Scheduling and Taking Time Off, or IRM 6.451.1.12.2, Calculating Time Off and Supplemental Awards, a supplemental monetary award shall be paid for the value of the excess hours."
This award is paid because the employee is not authorized to receive time-off hours in excess of the limitation.
Note: Supervisor computation of TOA and supplemental monetary awards is subject to verification and processing by HCO HRSS office.
"Note: Time-Off Special Act/Manager Awards under section IRM 6.451.1.11.2, Time-Off Special Act/Manager Awards, shall not have any time-off in excess of the 40-hour limitation converted into a monetary award per 5 CFR 451.104(f)."
"6.451.1.13 (09-02-2025)
Bilingual Awards
Bilingual Awards are Special Act Awards automatically granted to BU and NBU employees assigned to a bilingual or interpreter position description (PD) who use their bilingual or interpreter skills on a regular basis and are currently rated at least Fully Successful."
These awards will be funded separately from performance awards.
"BU and NBU employees will receive the same, negotiated award value."
"6.451.1.13.1 (09-02-2025)
Bilingual Awards Eligibility
Eligibility is based on the employee’s assigned position."
"BU and NBU employees assigned to a bilingual PD who, on a regular basis rather than occasionally, utilize their bilingual skills and whose performance is currently rated at least Fully Successful are eligible to receive a Bilingual Award of the negotiated amount beginning with the FY24 performance cycle."
Bilingual Awards may be granted only to individual employees either as monetary or TOAs.
Bilingual Awards may be granted to employees with a Fully Successful rating assigned to a bilingual PD for at least 60 calendar days during the rating period.
"Time spent in leave without pay, in a non-pay status, or as a part-time employee does not impact this award."
These awards are generally issued during the first quarter of the FY based on performance for the prior FY appraisal period.
Providing a Bilingual Award does not exclude employees from receiving a Performance Award.
"Employees who were not assigned to a bilingual or interpreter PD but who, on a regular basis rather than occasionally, utilize their bilingual or interpreter skills, may be entitled to a Bilingual Award."
"For BU and NBU employees, the supervisor must apply the criteria in Article 18, Section 6, of the 2025 Addendum to the 2022 NA to determine whether a Bilingual Award is warranted."
Employees will be eligible to receive only one Bilingual Award per calendar year.
"6.451.1.14 (09-02-2025)
Employee Referral Bonus Program (ERBP)
The Employee Referral Bonus Program provides recognition for IRS employees who refer qualified external (i.e., non-IRS) job candidate(s) who are selected for employment and remain on the job for the designated period."
"Covered Employees - All GS and GL employees serving on a permanent appointment and described under IRM 6.451.1.14.1, Employee Referral Bonus Eligibility Criteria, are covered under the ERBP."

An Advisory Committee Member who is currently on committees or who have been on committees within the past year."
Hard-to-Fill Position (HTF) - means the IRS is likely to have difficulty recruiting qualified candidates with the competencies required for a position in the absence of an incentive.
"IRS must consider factors in 5 CFR 575.106(b), as applicable, to determine whether a position is likely to be HTF."
"The basis for the determination may include lacking the availability of applicants, hard-to-find skill sets, less than desirable duties, work environment, appointment type, work schedule and/or geographic location."
"6.451.1.14.1 (04-04-2024)
Employee Referral Bonus Eligibility Criteria
To be eligible for an ERBP award, the referring employee must meet all the following criteria:

Be on the IRS rolls when the candidate is referred, as of the candidate’s entrance on duty (EOD), and at the time the award is made (see below for exception made when the referring employee retires),
Must have referred an individual who is not considered a relative."
"Refer to the definition under IRM 6.451.1.15, Employee Referral Bonus Program (ERBP), (4) Qualified External Candidates, and
A referring employee who retires prior to the candidate’s EOD will still be eligible for the ERBP award, so long as the referring employee was employed by the IRS on the date the candidate submitted their application."
Note: Any employee who improperly makes promises of employment to candidates or engages in inappropriate conduct as it relates to this program will be denied an award and may be subject to discipline.
The IRS HCO will post the positions designated as HTF and eligible for an ERBP award.
The HTF listing consists of Mission Critical Occupations (MCO) and Direct Hiring Authority (DHA) series.
Business units will socialize the vacancy announcement(s) and any associated ERBP award using established communication outlets.
"Business units will also:
Approve the HTF designation for notation in the automated system."
Ensure funding is available from the Deputy Commissioner for employee referral bonuses.

IRS Federal Career Service Recognition Program
The IRS values each employee as a vital member of the organization."

"At key points during their careers, IRS employees shall be awarded federal career service recognition items to emphasize appreciation for their IRS service and to the federal government."
Creditable Federal Service (Eligibility).
"IRS uses the Leave Service Computation Date, as captured in TIMIS, to determine eligibility for a Career Service Recognition Award."
All civilian service for departments or agencies of the federal government and only military service that is creditable for service computation date purposes are used when determining federal career service recognition eligibility.
Service credit granted for prior non-federal work experience and experience in a uniformed service for determining the annual leave accrual rate of a newly appointed employee is not creditable to determine eligibility for a Career Service Recognition Award.
Career service emblems consist of federal career service certificates and the IRS career service plaques.
"Career service certificates for 5 years, 10 years, and 15 years of service are emailed to the employee’s immediate supervisor."
The supervisor has the option to email the certificate or present the certificate to the employee.
"Career service plaques recognize creditable federal civilian and honorable military service for 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60 years of service."
Career service plaques are standardized throughout the IRS.
Plaques are engraved with the employee’s name of record and indicate the specific milestone year.
"Recognition presentation events are discussed in IRM 6.451.1.20, Award Presentation Ceremonies."
"The HCO, HRSS, Philadelphia Payroll Center (PPC) is responsible for requisitioning and providing mementoes to employees."
The mementoes typically arrive the month the employee is due the award.
"The PPC provides guidance and procedures about employee eligibility and the ordering, stocking, distribution and replacement of career service certificates and plaques."
Additional information can be found on the Career Service Recognition site.

Award Presentation Ceremonies
Responsible officials should publicly recognize employees as they reach significant career milestones or are granted other awards."

"Presentations shall be made in an appropriate and dignified setting, such as group or staff meetings or scheduled employee recognition ceremonies."
"Ideally, presentations should be made as close to the anniversary date of the career milestone or granting of the award as possible."
"However, supervisors may determine that periodic ceremonies where large numbers of eligible employees may be honored are also appropriate."
"The IRS Managers’ Recognition Toolkit and IRM 1.32.20, Using Appropriated Funds to Purchase Meals and Light Refreshments, provides guidance on purchasing light refreshments for employee recognition events."
"6.451.1.21 (09-02-2025)

"6.630.2.1.6 (07-28-2023)
Definitions
Any 12-month period: The any 12-month period strictly relates to the basic FMLA entitlement and is different than the single 12-month period for military purposes."
The any 12-month period of basic FMLA-Leave Without Pay (LWOP) begins on the date an employee first takes leave for an approved FMLA need and continues for 12 months.
Leave taken may begin prior to or on the actual date of need and the 12-month period begins on that date.
The employee is not entitled to 12 additional administrative workweeks of basic FMLA-LWOP until the previous 12-month period ends.
"Child of a covered servicemember: The covered servicemember’s biological, adopted, foster, stepchild, legal ward, or a child for whom the covered servicemember stood in loco parentis and who may be of any age."
"Covered active duty:
In the case of a member of a regular component of the Armed Forces, duty during the deployment of the member with Armed Forces to a foreign country; and
In the case of a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces, duty during the deployment of the member with the Armed Forces to a foreign country under a call or order to active duty under a provision of law referred to in 10 USC 101(a)(13)(B)."
"Covered servicemember:
A member of the Armed Forces (including a member of the National Guard or Reserves) who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness; or
A veteran who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, for a serious injury or illness and who was a member of the Armed Forces (including a member of the National Guard or Reserves) at any time during the period of five years preceding the date on which the veteran undergoes that medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy."
"Injury or Illness:
In the case of a member of the Armed Forces (including a member of the National Guard or Reserves), at any time during the five-year period described in 6.632.2.1.6 (4)(b), an injury or illness that was incurred by the member in the line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces (or existed before the beginning of the member’s active duty and was aggravated by service in the line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces) and that may render the member medically unfit to perform the duties of the member’s office, grade, rank, or rating; or
In the case of a veteran who was a member of the Armed Forces (including a member of the National Guard or Reserves) at any time during the specified five-year period, a serious injury or illness that was incurred by the member in the line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces, or existed before the beginning of the member’s active duty and was aggravated by service in the line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces, and that manifested itself before or after the member became a veteran."
"Outpatient status: With respect to a covered servicemember, means the status of a member of the Armed Forces assigned to:
A military medical treatment facility as an outpatient; or
A unit established for the purpose of providing command and control of members of the Armed Forces receiving medical care as an outpatient."
"Single 12-month period:
Strictly relates to 26-week FMLA military family leave and means the period beginning on the first day the employee takes FMLA military family leave to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness and ending 12 months after that date."
This is different than the any 12-month period under the basic FMLA 12-week entitlement.
Covered family members are entitled to up to 26 administrative workweeks of FMLA military family leave during a single 12-month period to care for the servicemember or veteran (referred to as military family leave).
"During the single 12-month period, an employee is entitled to a combined total of 26 administrative workweeks of basic FMLA leave and military family leave if the basic FMLA leave is initiated after the beginning of the single 12-month period."
"• For example, if during the single 12-month period of 26-week military family leave, an employee requests to take six administrative workweeks of basic FMLA leave for the birth of a child, the six administrative workweeks of basic FMLA leave is subtracted from the combined entitlement of 26 administrative workweeks, leaving the employee with 20 administrative workweeks of the 26-week military family leave for care of the servicemember."
The use of this 26-week military family leave in a single 12-month period does not limit the use of basic FMLA leave outside of the single 12-month period.
"• For example, if an employee uses any of the basic 12-week entitlement prior to the start of the 26 administrative workweeks of military family leave during a single 12-month period, it is possible the employee may be absent for a total of 38 administrative workweeks (26 weeks of military family leave plus 12 weeks of basic FMLA)."
"Similar to basic FMLA leave, 26-week military family leave is unpaid leave for which an employee may request to substitute any accumulated or accrued annual or sick leave, advanced annual or sick, and leave from the Leave Sharing Program in accordance with rules and regulations governing those programs."
"An employee may substitute up to 26 administrative workweeks (1,040 hours) of accumulated or accrued annual or sick leave for this purpose."
The normal leave year limitations on the use of sick leave for all family care do not apply.
"See IRM 6.630.1.5.5, Sick Leave for Family Care."
"Spouse: A partner in any legally recognized or defined marriage, regardless of the employee’s state of residency, to include common law marriages in states where they are recognized."
It does not include unmarried domestic partners of the same or opposite sex or unrecognized common law relationships.
"Veteran: A person who, under 38 USC 101, served in the active military, naval, or air service, and who was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable."

Military Leave for Reserves or National Guard
Military leave is defined as the authorized absence of an employee from official duty to perform active military duty, active duty for training, inactive-duty training, funeral honors duty, or to engage in field or coast defense training."
An employee on military leave under 5 USC 6323(a) receives full civilian salary as well as military pay.
"A full-time employee on a permanent or temporary indefinite appointment (defined by Comptroller General Decision (CG) B-232438 [1989] as temporary appointment for one year or more), who is a member of the reserve components of the Armed Forces, is entitled to 15 days (equivalent to 120 hours) of paid military leave each fiscal year."
Under 5 U.S.C.
"6323(c), unlimited military leave may be provided only to members of the National Guard of the District of Columbia for certain types of duty ordered or authorized under title 49 of the District of Columbia Code."
"See also: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/military-leave/
An employee on a temporary limited appointment (for less than one year) is not eligible for military leave even if the appointment is extended beyond the one-year timeframe (CG B-232438 [1989])."
"An employee on an intermittent work schedule does not earn leave, and therefore, is not eligible for military leave."
See IRM 6.630.1.2(8).
Military leave eligibility is based on the employee's current appointment.
"Therefore, if an employee on a temporary limited appointment (for less than one year) is converted to a permanent or temporary indefinite appointment (for one year or more), then eligibility is based on the new appointment, and the employee is eligible for military leave."
An eligible employee who does not use the entire 120 hours (or 15 days) may carry over up to 120 hours from one fiscal year to the next.
"Therefore, an employee may use a maximum of 240 hours in a fiscal year."
Military leave is charged for hours an employee otherwise would have worked.
An employee is not charged military leave on weekends or other non-workdays and receives full civilian pay for all 120 hours.
Military leave is not authorized for certain types of duty.
"An employee may request other approved leave or LWOP to engage in these activities:
Summer training as members of Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC)
Temporary members of the Coast Guard reserve
Participation in parades by members of a state National Guard
Training with a state defense organization or a state military organization that is not part of the National Guard
Weekly meetings and drills as a member of the District of Columbia National Guard
Time to travel on a workday to a place of training unless orders encompass travel time
Active duty as a commissioned officer in the Reserve Corps of the United States Public Health Service
Employees called to active duty should obtain a Military Benefits Election Check List for IRS Employees Entering Active Service available at: https://irssource.web.irs.gov/Linked%20Documents%20Library/Mil_Benefits_Election_Checklist.pdf, or by emailing Military.Deployment.Program@irs.gov."
An employee or manager must submit orders for active duty or military training along with certification after attendance containing dates of military duty to *Military Deployment Program at: Military.Deployment.Program@irs.gov or fax to 885-875-6606.
The Military Deployment team will process the required personnel action request (PAR) to complete the employee’s record.
"This is required when the employee has reemployment rights under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), regardless of the number of days absent."
"6.630.2.2.1 (03-15-2013)
Computation of Military Leave Accrual for Part-Time Employees
Military leave for part-time employees accrues at a rate based on the number of hours in the regularly scheduled tour of duty (TOD) as documented on their SF-50, Notification of Personnel Action."
"In computing the allowable military leave, use the following formula:
120 x (__/40) = ___."
Multiply 120 hours (the number of hours a full-time employee would accrue) by the number of hours in the employee’s weekly TOD divided by 40 (the number of hours a full-time employee works per week).
The result is the number of military hours the employee will accrue for the current fiscal year.
• Example: 120 X (20/40) = 60.
"In this example, the employee works 20 hours per week."
The employee is entitled to 60 hours of military leave in the current fiscal year.

Requesting Military Leave for Reserves or National Guard
To be eligible for military leave if ordered to active duty, an employee is responsible for providing military orders or a letter of required attendance to their immediate manager."
(Follow the instructions available in the Military Benefits Election Check List for IRS Employees Entering Active Military Service at: https://irssource.web.irs.gov/Linked%20Documents%20Library/Mil_Benefits_Election_Checklist.pdf.)
"An employee requesting military leave must submit the request as soon as possible, and furnish military orders before entering on active duty in accordance with (1) above;
The employee requesting military leave must also provide a Department of Defense (DD) 214 discharge document or a letter of attendance signed by the commanding officer upon return to duty."

Military Leave to Enforce the Law or in Support of a Contingency Operation
There are two conditions where an employee is entitled to an additional 22 workdays of military leave per calendar year under this provision of the law:
Military leave for military aid to enforce the law: Under 5 USC 6323(b), an employee is entitled to an additional 22 workdays of military leave per calendar year, when their duty is considered military aid to enforce the law, such as a Reservist or National Guard member performing military duty in support of civil authorities, in the protection of life and property, or when the National Guard is used in response to disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes, or the maintenance of law and order is a prime function of the assigned military duties (see IRM 6.630.2.3.3 below for salary consideration); and
Military leave for service in support of a contingency operation: Under 5 USC 6323(b), and employee is entitled to an additional 22 workdays of military leave per calendar year when they perform full-time military service or active duty in support of a contingency operation as defined in 10 USC 101(a)(13)."
"6.630.2.3.1 (07-28-2023)
Requesting Military Leave to Enforce the Law or in Support of a Contingency Operation
To be eligible for the additional 22 days of military leave to enforce the law, or in support of a contingency operation, an employee must
Receive orders activating their status or certification signed by an appropriate military official indicating the dates of service;
Notify their manager as soon as possible;
Provide their manager a copy of their military orders, or a statement by the commanding officer, which shows the duty is for the purpose of providing military aid to enforce the law, including the authorization, extent and nature of the service, must be provided to the manager to facilitate the crediting of military pay against civilian pay; in accordance with 5 USC 6323(b), an employee’s pay must not be reduced due to absence when granted leave under this subsection."
"If an employee plans to exceed all of this type of military leave during the current calendar year, they must notify management as soon as possible regarding how to post the IRS T&A record(s) to reflect additional periods of absence (e.g., annual leave, LWOP, etc.)."
An employee performing this type of military duty does not lose entitlement to regularly scheduled night pay differential or regularly scheduled overtime.
(See IRM 6.550.2.2.17.)
This type of military leave is not charged for absences on days when the employee is not regularly scheduled to work.
An employee's regularly scheduled workweek cannot be altered solely to increase entitlement to compensation for military purposes.
There is no authority to carry over any unused portion of the 22 days of this type of military leave to the next calendar year.

Salary Considerations for Military Leave to Enforce the Law or in Support of a Contingency Operation
Military leave to enforce the law or in support of a contingency operation (under 5 USC 6323(a)) entitles the eligible employee to the greater of the military or civilian pay (49 Comp."
Gen. 233).
"In accordance with 5 USC 5519, the amount received by an employee for their military service (under 5 USC 6323(b)) as a member of the Reserve or National Guard, for a period for which they are granted military leave, shall be credited against the pay payable to the employee with respect to their civilian position for that period."
"(This reduction does not include travel, transportation, or per diem allowance.)"
.
An employee must refund the IRS the military base pay received for the days of absence that occur on workdays.
"The employee must repay a dollar amount equal to the military pay received (less any travel, transportation, or per diem allowances) up to the amount of their civilian pay."
The military pay to be refunded applies only to this type of military leave.

Disabled Veteran Leave
Disabled veteran leave is authorized and administered under 5 USC 6329 and 5 CFR 630, Subpart M.
Disabled veteran leave:
Applies to an employee who is a veteran hired on or after November 5, 2016, with a service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more for purposes of undergoing medical treatment for such disability;
Is a one-time entitlement and may not exceed 104 hours for a regular full-time employee, and is prorated for an employee with a part-time TOD;
Must be used during the 12-month period beginning on the first day of employment;
Addresses newly hired federal employee veterans who have a zero balance of sick leave when initially appointed, and need medical treatment for their service-connected disability."
"An employee may use this leave in lieu of sick leave without having to take LWOP, accrued sick or annual leave, or advanced leave; and
Is automatically deposited in its own category in an employee’s account, separate from regular sick leave."
"6.630.2.5.1 (07-28-2023)
Definitions
12-month eligibility period: The continuous 12-month period that begins on the first day of employment."
First day of employment: The first day of employment establishes the beginning of the 12-month eligibility period for disabled veterans leave.
"It is the first day of service that qualifies as employment after a qualifying service-connected disability has been established by the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), such as the following:
The date an employee is hired after the effective date of their qualifying service-connected disability has been determined by the VBA."
"(For example, if the qualifying service-connected disability was determined by the VBA on November 1, and the employee’s first day of employment is December 1, the beginning of the 12-month eligibility period is December 1; or
If the employee has been hired on a date before their qualifying service-connected disability has been established by the VBA, the beginning of the 12-month eligibility period will be the effective date of the employee’s qualifying service-connected disability as determined by the VBA."
"(For example, if the employee’s first day of employment is September 1, but their qualifying service-connected disability is not established by the VBA until October 1, the beginning of the 12-month eligibility period is October 1.)"
"Hired: The action (on or after November 5, 2016) of:
Receiving an initial appointment to a civilian position in the federal government;
Receiving a qualifying reappointment to a civilian position in the federal government; or
Returning to duty status in a civilian position in the federal government, which immediately followed a break in civilian duty (with the employee in continuous civilian leave status) to perform military service."
Medical certificate: A written statement signed by a health care provider certifying to the treatment of a veteran’s qualifying service-connected disability.
Medical treatment: Any activity carried out or prescribed by a health care provider to treat a veteran’s qualifying service-connected disability.
Qualifying reappointment: An appointment of a former employee of the federal government following a break in employment of at least 90 calendar days.
"Qualifying service-connected disability: A veteran’s service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more by the VBA, including a combined degree of disability of 30 percent or more that reflects the combined effect of multiple individual disabilities, which resulted in the award of disability compensation under 38 USC."
A temporary disability rating under 38 USC 1156 is considered a valid rating in applying this definition for as long as it is in effect.
"Service-connected: Refers to a disability that was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service (as determined by VBA), as defined under 38 USC 101(16)."
Veterans Benefits Administration: means the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
"6.630.2.5.2 (07-28-2023)
Employee Coverage
The following requirements must be met in order for an employee to be eligible for disabled veteran leave."
"An employee must:
Be a veteran in the civil service (as defined in 5 USC 2101);
Be covered by the disabled veteran leave statute (as defined in 5 USC 6329;
Be hired on or after November 5, 2016; and
Be subject to a leave system for which leave is charged for absences."
"6.630.2.5.3 (12-18-2018)
Eligibility
An employee who is a veteran with a qualifying service-connected disability is entitled to disabled veteran leave, which will be available for use during the 12-month eligibility period beginning on the first day of employment."
"For each employee, there is a single first day of employment."
Employees not covered by a leave system (such as those with intermittent work schedules) are not covered by the disabled veteran leave authority.
"To be eligible for disabled veteran leave, an employee must provide documentation from the VBA certifying that they have a qualifying service-connected disability."
"The documentation should be provided to the IRS:
Upon the first day of employment, if they have already received such certifying documentation, or
For an employee who has not yet received certifying documentation from the VBA, as soon as practicable after they receive the certifying documentation."
"Notwithstanding paragraph (3) of this section, an employee may submit certifying documentation at a later time, including after a period of absence for medical treatment, as described in 5 CFR 630.1306(c)."
The 12-month eligibility period is fixed and is based on the first day of employment and is not affected by the timing of when certifying documentation is provided.
"If an employee's service-connected disability rating is decreased or discontinued during the 12-month eligibility period and they no longer have a qualifying service-connected disability (i.e., the disability rating falls below 30 percent), the employee:
Must notify the IRS of the effective date of the change in the disability rating; and
Is no longer eligible for disabled veteran leave as of the effective date of the rating change."
"6.630.2.5.4 (12-18-2018)
Crediting Disabled Veteran Leave
Disabled veteran leave can only be credited once an employee provides the necessary certifying documentation to the IRS to confirm their eligibility."
"The eligible employee must be credited with the appropriate amount of disabled veteran leave as of their “first day of employment.”
Crediting Hours by Work Schedule:
An employee under a regular full-time work schedule will receive an initial crediting of 104 hours of disabled veteran leave."
An employee who has a part-time or seasonal work schedule will receive a proportionally equivalent amount of disabled veteran leave initially credited based upon the hours in their work schedule.
(For more information see 5 CFR 630.1305(a).)
"Use the following formulas to compute the number of disabled veteran leave hours initially credited, where “hours” means hours in the employee’s established TOD or work schedule."
• Part-time Work Schedule (non-seasonal): (hours/80) x 104.
"For example, for employees who work 20 hours/week or 40 hours biweekly: (40/80) x 104 = 52 hours disabled veteran leave."
"• Seasonal Work Schedule (part-time or full-time): (hours/2,080) x 104."
"For example, for employees who are projected to work full-time for half year: (1,040/2,080) x 104 = 52 hours of disabled veteran leave and for employees who are projected to work part-time (20 hours per week) for half year: (520/2,080) x 104 = 26 hours disabled veteran leave."
"Offsetting Disabled Veteran Leave:
The initial crediting of disabled veteran leave may be subject to offset (reduction), and the hours must be offset by any hours of sick leave to the employee’s credit as of the “first day of employment”; or any hours of “equivalent” disabled veteran leave used by an employee in a position not covered by 5 USC 6329 (i.e., equivalent leave granted under another authority such as the personnel authority of the Federal Aviation Administration or the Transportation Security Administration."
"An employee may have a sick leave balance as of the first day of employment in the following situations:

1) A former federal employee is rehired after a break in service of at least 90 days and the rehire date qualifies as the “first day of employment” triggering eligibility for disabled veteran leave."
The rehired employee is entitled to a recredit of the former sick leave balance.
"The recredited sick leave hours will offset the initial crediting of disabled veteran leave hours, which could reduce or eliminate the disabled veteran leave benefit and requires time and attendance record adjustments;
2) A veteran is first hired in a qualifying position as a federal employee on or after November 5, 2016, and does not have eligibility for disabled veteran leave as of the hire date."
"Later, the veteran files a claim for VA disability compensation, which is approved, and the effective date of the disability rating is after the hire date."
That effective date of the VBA disability rating is the “first day of employment” and the start date of the 12-month eligibility period for using disabled veteran leave.
"The hours of sick leave to the employee’s credit (if any) as of that start date would offset the initial crediting of disabled veteran leave hours; or
3) A federal employee is called to perform military duty as a reservist."
"After their military service, the employee qualifies for disabled veteran leave."
The hours of sick leave to their credit (if any) as of the start date of the 12-month eligibility period would offset the initial crediting of disabled veteran leave hours.
"Conversion of Disabled Veteran Leave Balance Based on Change in a TOD:
When an employee is converted to a different TOD for leave purposes, including in conjunction with movement to a different agency, the employee’s balance of unused disabled veteran leave must be converted to the proper number of hours based on the proportion of hours in the new TOD compared to the former TOD."
"For seasonal employees, hours must be annualized in determining the proportion."
"• For example, if an employee has a balance of 60 hours of disabled veteran leave and changes from a full-time schedule (80 hours per biweekly pay period) to a half-time schedule (part-time schedule of 40 hours per biweekly pay period), the 60-hour balance would be converted to a 30-hour balance [60 x (40/80) = 30]."
"When an employee moves from a Postal agency to the IRS, the balance at the time of separation under Postmaster General regulations will be carried over and will be adjusted during the 12-month eligibility period only when hours of disabled veteran leave are used."
"6.630.2.5.5 (12-18-2018)
Requesting and Using Disabled Veteran Leave
An employee must apply in written, electronic, or oral format to use disabled veteran leave."
"While noting these requirements, manager’s are encouraged to be as flexible as possible when granting this leave to eligible employees."
"The application must:
Include a personal self-certification by the employee that the requested leave will be (or was) used for purposes of receiving medical treatment for a qualifying service-connected disability;
Include the specific days and hours of absence required for the treatment; and
Be submitted as far in advance as reasonably possible."
"An employee must request approval to use disabled veteran leave as far in advance as reasonably possible, appropriate to the circumstances involved, unless the need for leave is critical and not foreseeable (e.g., due to a medical emergency or the unexpected availability of an appointment for surgery or other critical treatment)."
"If the need for leave is critical and not foreseeable, the leave may not be delayed or denied if the employee is unable to provide advance notice."
An employee may use disabled veteran leave only for the medical treatment of a qualifying service-connected disability.
"The medical treatment may include a period of rest, but only if specifically ordered by the health care provider as part of a prescribed course of treatment for the qualifying service-connected disability."
"When an employee did not provide the IRS employment office with certification of a qualifying service-connected disability before having a period of absence for treatment of the disability, they are entitled to substitute approved disabled veteran leave retroactively for the period of absence (excluding periods of suspension or absence without leave (AWOL), but including LWOP, sick leave, annual leave, compensatory time off, or other paid time off) in the 12-month eligibility period."
"Before retroactive substitution is approved, an employee may be required to submit medical certification within 15 calendar days unless it’s determined that more time is required (not to exceed 30 calendar days)."
Retroactive substitution cancels the use of the original leave or paid time off and requires T&A record adjustments.
"In the case of retroactive substitution for a period when an employee used advanced annual leave or advanced sick leave, the adjustment results in the employee not being responsible for a debt."
"(See also IRM 1.36.4.2 Administrative Accounting and Financial Management Reports, Administrative (Non-Tax) Debt Management."
"6.630.2.5.6 (12-18-2018)
Medical Certification
In addition to an employee's required self-certification, they must submit a signed written medical certification issued by a health care provider to their manager, that includes:
A statement by the health care provider that the medical treatment is for one or more service-connected disabilities that resulted in 30 percent or more disability rating;
The date or dates of treatment or, if the treatment extends over several days, the beginning and ending dates of the treatment;
A statement that the treatment required was of an urgent nature or there were other circumstances that prevented advanced scheduling, if the leave was not requested in advance; and
Any additional information that is essential to verify the employee's eligibility."
"An employee must provide their manager any required written medical certification no later than 15 calendar days after the date the manager requests it, unless it is not practicable under the circumstances for the employee to provide the requested medical certification within 15 calendar days."
The leave may be used for any of the disabilities listed in the veteran’s disability rating determination that were combined to reach a total disability rating of 30 percent or more.
"If the employee is unable to provide the requested medical certification within 15 calendar days, despite their diligent, good faith efforts, the medical certification must be provided within a reasonable period of time under the circumstances involved, but no later than 30 calendar days after it is requested."
"An employee who does not provide the required evidence or medical certification within the specified time period is not entitled to use disabled veteran leave, and the manager may, as appropriate and consistent with applicable laws and regulations:
Charge the employee as AWOL; or
Allow the employee to request a charge to LWOP, sick leave, annual leave, or other forms of paid time off."
"6.630.2.5.7 (12-18-2018)
Forfeiture, Transfer and Reinstatement
Disabled veteran leave not used during the 12-month eligibility period is not carried over to subsequent years and is forfeited."
"If a change in the employee's disability rating during the 12-month eligibility period causes the employee to no longer have a qualifying service-connected disability, the employee forfeits any unused disabled veteran leave as of the effective date of the rating change."
"During the 12-month eligibility period, when an employee with a positive disabled veteran leave balance transfers between positions in different agencies, or transfers from the United States Postal Service or Postal Regulatory Commission to a position in the IRS, the agency the employee transfers from must certify the number of unused disabled veteran leave hours available for credit."
Note: The term “transfers” means movement from a position in one agency (or the United States Postal Service or Postal Regulatory Commission) to a position in another agency without a break in employment of one workday or more in circumstances where service in both positions qualifies as employment.
"An employee with a balance of unused disabled veteran leave, who has a break in employment of at least one workday during the 12-month eligibility period, and returns later to qualifying Federal employment covered by 5 USC 6329 within that same eligibility period, is entitled to a recredit of the unused balance."
The losing agency must certify the number of unused disabled veteran leave hours and the expiration date of the employee’s established 12-month eligibility period.
Any unused disabled veteran leave must be forfeited at the end of that eligibility period.
"If certification is not available upon transfer or reinstatement, the recredit of disabled veteran leave may also be supported by:
Written documentation available to the IRS in the employee’s official personnel records;
The official records of the employee's former employing agency;
Copies of concurrent earnings and leave statement(s) provided by the employee; or
Copies of other concurrent written documentation acceptable to the IRS."
"If an employee’s work schedule changes in conjunction with movement to a different agency during the 12-month eligibility period, the balance of disabled veteran leave must generally be converted to the proper number of hours based on the proportional relationship between the two schedules, as described in 5 CFR 630.1305(c)."
An employee may not receive a lump-sum payment for any unused disabled veteran leave under any circumstance.
"6.630.2.6 (12-18-2018)
Qualifying Exigency FMLA Leave and 26-Week FMLA Military Family Leave
There are two types of military FMLA leave covered in this IRM:
Qualifying Exigency FMLA Leave: A period of absence tied to the deployment of a servicemember and/or other related activities described in IRM 6.630.2.6.2.1 ."
"This is covered under the basic 12-week provision under 5 USC 6381 through 6387 and 5 CFR, subpart L, which entitles an employee to a total of up to 12 administrative workweeks of basic FMLA unpaid leave during any 12-month period for certain family and medical needs."
26-Week FMLA Military Family Leave: A period of absence for an employee providing care for a covered servicemember who became ill or was injured in the line of duty.
"General parameters such as eligibility, features, limitations, and procedures for applying for all types of FMLA are the same."
"However, provisions that apply to military also appear below."
"For information on non-military-related leave such as birth of a child or serious personal illness, see IRM 6.630.1.9, Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)."
"6.630.2.6.1 (12-18-2018)
FMLA - Eligibility
An employee requesting qualifying exigency FMLA leave or 26-week FMLA military family leave must:
Be the spouse, child, parent, or next of kin (defined as the nearest blood relative) of a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness;
Be covered by the Federal leave system; and
Have completed 12 consecutive or nonconsecutive months of Federal service."
An employee serving under a temporary appointment with a time limitation of one year or less as well as an employee assigned to an intermittent work schedule is not eligible.
"6.630.2.6.2 (12-18-2018)
Reasons for Use
An employee may use military-related FMLA for:
Qualifying exigencies: Arising out of the fact that an employee’s spouse, child or parent is a covered military member on covered active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty) in the Armed Forces; and
26-Week FMLA Military Family Leave: When an employee is the spouse, child, parent, or next of kin (defined as the nearest blood relative) of a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness incurred in the line of duty and provides care for such servicemember."
"6.630.2.6.2.1 (01-06-2017)
Qualifying Exigencies - Covered Active Duty or Call to Covered Active Duty Status
An employee may request up to 12 administrative workweeks of military-related FMLA leave while their spouse, child, or parent is on covered active duty or called to covered active duty status for one or more of the following qualifying exigencies, pertaining to leave for a covered military member:
Short-notice deployment: To address any issue that arises from the fact that a covered military member is notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty seven or fewer calendar days prior to the date of deployment."
Leave taken for this purpose can be used for a period of up to seven calendar days beginning on the date a covered military member is notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty.
"Military events and related activities: 1) To attend any official ceremony, program, or event sponsored by the military that is related to the covered active duty or call to active duty status; and 2) To attend family support or assistance programs and informational briefings sponsored or promoted by the military, military service organizations, or the American Red Cross that are related to the covered active duty or call to covered active duty status."
"Child care and school activities: For purposes of this section, “child” means a biological, adopted or foster child, a stepchild or a legal ward of a covered military member, or a child for whom a covered military member stands in loco parentis, who is either under age 18, or age 18 or older and incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability at the time the military-related FMLA leave is to begin."
"Activities include:
1) To arrange for alternative child care when the covered active duty or call to covered active duty status of a covered military member necessitates a change in the existing child care arrangement,
2) To provide child care on an urgent, immediate need basis (not on a routine, regular, or everyday basis) when the need to provide such care arises from the covered active duty or call to covered active duty status,
3) To enroll in or transfer a child to a new school or day care facility, when enrollment or transfer is necessitated by the covered active duty or call to covered active duty status, and
4) To attend meetings with staff at a school or a day care facility, such as meetings with school officials regarding disciplinary measures, parent-teacher conferences, or meetings with school counselors, for a child when such meetings are necessary due to circumstances arising from the covered active duty or call to covered active duty status."
"Financial and legal arrangements:
1) To make or update financial or legal arrangements to address the covered military member’s absence while on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status, such as preparing and executing financial and health care powers of attorney, transferring bank account signature authority, enrolling in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), obtaining military identification cards, or preparing or updating a will or living trust; and
2) To act as the covered military member’s representative before a Federal, State, or local agency for purposes of obtaining, arranging, or appealing military service benefits while the covered military member is on covered active duty or call to covered active duty status, and for a period of 90 days following the termination of the covered military member’s covered active duty status."
"Counseling: To attend counseling provided by someone other than a health care provider for oneself, for the covered military member, or for a child, provided that the need for counseling arises from the covered active duty or call to covered active duty status of a covered military member."
"Rest and recuperation: To spend time with a covered military member who is on short-term, temporary, rest and recuperation leave during the period of deployment."
Eligible employees may take up to five days of military-related FMLA leave for each instance of rest and recuperation.
"Post-deployment activities:
1) To attend arrival ceremonies, reintegration briefings and events, and any other official ceremony or program sponsored by the military for a period of 90 days following the termination of the covered military member’s covered active duty status; and
2) To address issues that arise from the death of a covered military member while on covered active duty status, such as meeting and recovering the body of the covered military member and making funeral arrangements."
"Additional activities: To address other events that arise out of the covered military member’s covered active duty or call to covered active duty status, provided that the agency and employee agree that such leave qualifies as an exigency, and that they agree to both the timing and duration of such leave."
"6.630.2.6.2.2 (01-06-2017)
26-Week FMLA Military Family Leave
The NDAA for FY 2008 and FY 2010 (public laws 110-181 and 111-84) provide that an employee who is the spouse, child, parent, or next of kin of a covered servicemember who is injured or became ill in the line of duty while in Active duty may use up to 26 administrative workweeks of FMLA military family leave during a single 12-month period for the purpose of caring for the servicemember."
"A full-time employee is entitled to use:
Twenty-six administrative workweeks (1,040 hours) of unpaid LWOP (26-week FMLA military family leave) during a single 12-month period to provide care for such servicemember undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy for a serious injury or illness."
These 26 administrative workweeks do not include holidays and non-workdays.
"For a part-time employee, the amount of unpaid LWOP (26-week FMLA military family leave) entitlement during a single 12-month period is prorated."
The amount of leave granted for this purpose may not exceed an amount equal to 26 times the average number of hours in their scheduled TOD each week.
"• For example, an employee who works 20 hours a week may use a maximum of 520 hours (20 hours a week x 26 = 520 total.)"
"In addition to this 26-week FMLA military family leave, an employee may request basic 12-week qualifying exigency FMLA leave while their spouse, child, or parent (the covered military member) is on covered active duty or on a call to covered active duty status for a qualifying exigency (see IRM 6.630.2.6.2.1 above)."
"During a single 12-month period, however, an employee is only entitled to a combined total of 26 administrative workweeks of basic qualifying exigency FMLA leave and 26-week FMLA military family leave."
"6.630.2.6.3 (01-06-2017)
Features and Limitations of Qualifying Exigency FMLA Leave and 26-Week FMLA Military Family Leave
An employee may not be denied if the request meets the FMLA criteria as defined by 5 CFR 630, subpart L.
An employee may use these types of FMLA in conjunction with other types of leave or leave programs (e.g., voluntary leave transfer program)."
An employee may use these types of FMLA leave intermittently or under a work schedule reduced by the number of hours of exigency basic FMLA leave when mutually agreed upon between the employee’s manager and the employee.
"An employee may substitute paid leave for unpaid leave under FMLA, (i.e., annual and/or sick leave consistent with laws and regulations governing the granting and use of annual or sick leave, advanced annual and/or sick leave, and/or leave made available under the voluntary leave sharing programs)."
"An employee may not substitute compensatory time off in lieu of overtime, compensatory time off for travel, credit hours, or time off awards for unpaid FMLA leave (FMLA-LWOP)."
"FMLA-LWOP as well as annual or sick leave substituted for FMLA-LWOP, may be taken in 15-minute increments."
"An employee may not retroactively invoke their entitlement to any FMLA, unless they provide proof of:
Physical or mental incapacity making them incapable of invoking entitlement during the entire period of absence from work; and
A personal representative was also unable to contact the agency and invoke the entitlement to FMLA during the entire period of absence."
An employee who meets this criteria must invoke entitlement within two workdays after returning to work status.
"Upon return to work, an employee is entitled to the same or equivalent position, benefits, pay, status, and other conditions of employment."
"If an employee is on any FMLA-LWOP, they are entitled to maintain health benefits as long as they have made arrangements to pay their share of costs on a current basis or upon return to work status."
"Periods of any FMLA-LWOP may have significant impact on employee benefits (e.g., leave accrual (see IRM 6.630.1.2))."
"See OPM’s fact sheet, titled Effect of Extended Leave Without Pay (LWOP) (or Other Nonpay Status) on Federal Benefits and Programs, at: https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/effect-of-extended-leave-without-pay-lwop-or-other-nonpay-status-on-federal-benefits-and-programs/."
Information on the impact of LWOP is also found on the IRS Source.
"Requests are approved by the employee’s immediate manager, who should contact the servicing LR/ER specialist if questions arise."
"6.630.2.6.4 (01-06-2017)
Requirements
Both qualifying exigency FMLA leave and 26-week FMLA military family leave must be invoked by an employee, in written, oral, or electronic format."
"Where the need for either of these two types of FMLA leave is foreseeable, an employee must submit advance notice on recommended Form 9611, Application for Leave Under the Family and Medical Leave Act, which may be found at: https://irssource.web.irs.gov/lists/VeteransProgram/DispItemForm.aspx?ID=67&, no less than 30 days before the leave period."
"If the need for military-related FMLA leave is not foreseeable, the Form 9611 should be submitted within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the circumstances involved."
"If required for either of these two types of FMLA leave, an employee must submit medical certification within 15 calendar days of the manager’s request."
"If it is not possible under the circumstances to provide the requested medical certification within the 15 calendar days, despite the employee’s diligent, good faith efforts, the employee must submit the medical certification within a reasonable period of time under the circumstances involved, but no later than 30 calendar days after the date requested."
"If medical certification is not submitted within the specified period, an employee may be charged AWOL or request another type of paid leave or time off, as appropriate."
"Military-related certification will be provided by a Department of Defense health care provider, a VA health care provider, a Department of Defense TRICARE network private health care provider, or a Department of Defense non-network TRICARE authorized private health care provider."
An employee must provide notification of the intent to substitute paid leave for the period of unpaid qualified exigency FMLA leave or 26-week FMLA military family leave prior to the date the paid leave begins.
An employee may not substitute paid leave retroactively for unpaid qualifying exigency FMLA leave or unpaid 26-week FMLA military family leave previously taken.
"6.630.2.6.5 (07-28-2023)
Procedures for Applying
An employee may apply for qualifying exigency FMLA leave or 26-week FMLA military family leave to their immediate manager using recommended Form 9611, Application for Leave Under the Family and Medical Leave Act, which may be found at: https://irssource.web.irs.gov/lists/VeteransProgram/DispItemForm.aspx?ID=67&, no less than least 30 days before leave is to begin if the need for leave is foreseeable, or within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the circumstances involved if the need for leave is not foreseeable."

"While the employee is not required to use this form, they are still responsible for submitting all required information."
"An employee who requests 26-week FMLA military family leave may use Form WH-385, Certification for Serious Injury or Illness of Covered Servicemember for Military Family Leave, at: https://www.dol.gov/whd/forms/WH-385.pdf."
"While an employee is not required to use this form, they are still responsible for submitting all required medical and other information."
An employee may provide required medical certification directly to their immediate manager or through the designated IRS health services provider.
Requests are approved by the employee’s immediate manager and the manager should contact the servicing LR/ER specialist if questions arise.
"6.630.2.7 (01-06-2017)
Substitution of Sick Leave for Unpaid 26-Week FMLA Military Family Leave for a Covered Servicemember
An employee must invoke their entitlement and apply for 26-week FMLA military family leave to substitute paid sick leave under this subsection."
The 480-hour limit on the use of sick leave for all family care purposes within a leave year does not apply for this purpose.
"The amount of sick leave an employee may substitute for unpaid 26-week FMLA military family leave to care for a covered servicemember may not exceed:
Twenty-six administrative workweeks (1,040 hours) for a full-time employee in a “single 12-month period”; or
The amount equal to 26 times the average number of hours in their scheduled TOD each week for part-time employees in a “single 12-month period”."
"This provision is in addition to the sick leave employees may request to substitute for the basic 12-week (480 hour) entitlement to basic FMLA for other reasons, such as the birth of a child or adoption."
"An employee may also substitute accrued annual leave, advanced annual and/or sick leave, and any donated leave received through the leave transfer program for this purpose."
Requests are approved by the employee’s immediate manager and they should contact the servicing LR/ER specialist if questions arise.
"6.630.2.8 (01-06-2017)
Five-Days Excused Absence (Administrative Leave) for Returning Military Members
A returning military employee is entitled to five days of excused absence if they:
Return from performing active military service in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO),
Spend at least 42 consecutive days on active duty in support of OCO, and upon returning
Notify their manager of the specific return to duty date."
"A returning military employee is entitled to this excused absence only once during a 12-month period, with a new 12-month period beginning after the first use of the excused absence."
"If (1) a) through c) are met, the manager must grant the excused absence, and the employee must use all days immediately before returning to work."
See also: Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies (archives.gov) and 5 Days of Excused Absence for Employees Returning from Active Military Duty (opm.gov) .
"For additional information on the IRS Source, see Veterans Program Office (VPO) Resources at: https://irssource.web.irs.gov/Lists/VeteransProgram/DisplaySection.aspx?SectionName=3
6.630.2.9 (12-18-2018)
Reservist Differential Payments
A reservist differential payment may be made to an eligible member of the Reserve or National Guard if they are absent from their civilian position during qualifying periods while ordered to active duty under 10 USC 101(a)(13)(B) or 10 USC 12302 during a war or national emergency declared by the President or Congress."
Federal agencies must pay an employee who qualifies under certain provisions of 5 USC 5538 with a payment equal to the amount of their projected civilian basic pay for a covered pay period which exceeds the actual military pay and allowances for that pay period.
"To qualify, an employee must be entitled to reemployment rights under USERRA."
Reservist differential payments may not be made if an employee receives civilian basic pay for performing work or uses civilian paid leave or paid time off during that period.
An employee must provide Statements of Earnings and Leave from military agencies to use in the calculation process.
"6.630.2.10 (07-28-2023)
Lump-sum Payment for Annual Leave
An employee, including an employee covered under the IRS Payband System, who enters on active duty in the armed forces may elect to receive a lump-sum payment for accumulated and accrued annual leave or may request to have the annual leave remain to their credit until return from active duty."
"However, an agency must make a lump-sum payment for any annual leave previously restored under 5 USC 6304(d) when the employee enters active duty."
The agency may not re-credit the restored leave when the employee returns to Federal service.
"See IRM 6.550.1.7, Lump-sum Payment for Accumulated and Accrued Annual Leave, for additional information."

Background
The Administrative Leave Act of 2016 (the Act), enacted under Section 1138 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, created four new categories of statutorily authorized paid leave — administrative leave, investigative leave, notice leave and WSL."
The Act established parameters for the use of these types of leave by federal agencies.
This IRM establishes the internal policies of the IRS to meet the statutory and regulatory requirements pertaining to these types of leave.
"Read and interpret this guidance in accordance with applicable laws, governmentwide regulations, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) Human Capital Issuance System directives and orders, Comptroller General and U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) decisions, and other sources as applicable."

General Provisions
The Administrative Leave Act of 2016 (the Act), enacted under Section 1138 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Pub."
"L. 114-328, 130 Stat."
"2000, December 23, 2016), was enacted because Congress believed the use of administrative leave sometimes exceeded reasonable amounts and resulted in significant costs to the government."
"Congress wants agencies to (1) use administrative leave sparingly, (2) consider alternatives to use of administrative leave when an employee is under investigation, and (3) act expeditiously to conclude investigations and either return the employee to duty or take an appropriate personnel action."
Congress also wants agencies to keep accurate records regarding the use of administrative leave for various purposes.
"The Act added three new subparts to Title 5 USC that provide for specific categories of paid leave and the requirements that apply to each:
Subpart N, Administrative Leave (5 USC 6329a);
Subpart O, Investigative Leave and Notice Leave (5 USC 6329b); and
Subpart P, Weather and Safety Leave (5 USC 6329c)."
"6.630.4.3 (04-24-2020)
Administrative Leave
Per 5 USC 6329a, administrative leave is permitted, at an agency’s discretion, but subject to statutory and regulatory requirements, when an agency determines that no other paid leave is authorized under any other law."
"Under the statute, OPM has the authority and requirement to prescribe regulations to carry out the new statutory provisions of 5 USC 6329a, including the appropriate uses and the proper recording of administrative leave."
"The regulations, once published, will provide a framework for agency compliance with the new statutory requirements."
The statute provides that an agency may place an employee on administrative leave for no more than 10 total workdays (80 hours) in any CY for full-time employees and the prorated equivalent for part-time employees.
"The IRS policies for excused absence (administrative leave) contained in IRM 6.610.1, IRS Hours of Duty, remain current until OPM issues implementing regulations for 5 USC 6329a and until IRS policies are updated and moved to IRM 6.630.4.3."
"Policy changes will not apply to BU employees until bargaining obligations, if required by law, are met."
"6.630.4.4 (05-08-2023)
Investigative Leave and Notice Leave
Per 5 USC 6329b, investigative leave and notice leave provide the employing agency with the means of removing an employee from the workplace and keeping the employee away from the workplace while the agency investigates the employee and/or during the notice period of a proposed adverse action against that employee."
"Investigative leave and notice leave are not employee entitlements, but employees who are under investigation or who have received a notice of a proposed adverse action may be placed on this type of paid leave."
"Under the statute, OPM has the authority and requirement to prescribe regulations to carry out the new statutory provisions of 5 USC 6329b, including the appropriate uses and the proper recording of investigative leave and notice leave."
"Once OPM regulations are published, the IRS will revise and implement internal policies to meet the statutory and regulatory requirements pertaining to these types of leave."
"Policy changes will not apply to BU employees until bargaining obligations, if required by law, are met."
"For current guidance on administrative leave for misconduct related to discipline and adverse actions for non-EMU employees, a manager should consult with their servicing labor/employee relations specialist."
"For EMU-covered employees, a manager should consult with their EMU specialist."

"6.630.4.5 (05-08-2023)
Weather and Safety Leave
Per 5 USC 6329c, WSL is permitted, at an agency’s discretion, but subject to statutory and regulatory requirements, when an agency determines weather or other safety-related conditions prevent an employee from safely traveling to or from work or safely performing work at an approved location (typically their ODS or telework site) due to:
An act of God;
Terrorist attack; or
Other applicable condition."
"The OPM regulations at 5 CFR Part 630, Subpart P, Weather and Safety Leave, provide agencies with additional framework and requirements for granting and recording WSL."
"Agencies have discretion to grant this type of leave, subject to statutory and regulatory requirements, agency policies and lawful collective bargaining agreements."
There are no maximum number of hours (time limitations) that apply to WSL.
The time an employee is on WSL does not affect their creditable service or probationary period.
"The WSL provisions apply to employees as defined in 5 USC 2105, but do not apply to intermittent employees; that is, intermittent employees are not eligible for WSL."
"6.630.4.5.1 (05-08-2023)
Telework Employees and Use of WSL
Except as provided in (a) and (b) below, an employee who is participating in the IRS Telework Program and who can safely travel to and safely work at an approved telework site, may not be granted WSL."
"An employee who is eligible to telework and who participates in the IRS Telework Program under applicable IRS policies is typically able to safely perform work at their approved telework site (for example, home) since they are not required to work at their regular worksite."
(Refer to 5 CFR 630.1605(a).)
"If, in the manager’s judgment, the weather or safety-related conditions outlined above could not reasonably be anticipated, then WSL may be approved to the extent the employee was not able to prepare for telework (refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.1(4) below) and is otherwise unable to perform productive work at the telework site."
(Refer to 5 CFR 630.1605(a)(2)(i).)
"If the employee is prevented from safely working at the approved telework site due to circumstances arising from one or more of the weather or safety-related conditions outlined in IRM 6.630.4.5(1) above, applicable to the telework site, the manager may, at their discretion, provide WSL to the employee (per 5 CFR 630.1605(a)(2)(ii)) or may direct the employee to travel to the employee’s regular worksite (or if the employee is NBU, to an alternative worksite) provided they may safely travel."
"Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.8, Emergency at the Telework Site, for more information."
Exception: WSL may not be granted to a telework employee who is approved for the temporary exception to the 200-mile radius for telework site benefit (permitted for up to two pay periods per CY under Article 50 of the National Agreement (for BU employees) and passed-through to NBU employees in the Consolidated National Agreement “Pass-Through” Provisions found at: https://irsgov.sharepoint.com/sites/EmployeeResources/SitePages/EmployeeRightsAndObligations71.aspx).
"If unable to telework, an employee using this exception to the 200-mile radius benefit is required to use their own personal leave, other paid time off (such as previously earned credit hours or compensatory time) or LWOP."
This WSL prohibition does not apply to an employee who is approved to telework outside the 200-mile radius due to an approved hardship or approved reasonable accommodation.
"An employee requesting WSL for a period they are expected to telework must provide to their manager either optional Form 10837, Request for Weather and Safety Leave Due to Emergency Conditions, or other documentation supporting their claim."
"Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.10, WSL Requests and Documentation Requirements, for more information."
"A manager may decide not to approve WSL when the conditions in IRM 6.630.4.5(1) and IRM 6.630.4.5.1(1) above do not prevent the employee from safely traveling to or safely performing work at a regular work site (for example, ODS), even if the affected day is a scheduled telework day."
(Refer to 5 CFR 630.1605(a)(2)(iii).)
"When an employee with an approved telework agreement may reasonably anticipate that a weather or other safety-related condition may force the closure of their ODS, the employee must take reasonable steps (within an employee’s control) to become telework-ready (that is, take necessary work equipment and necessary work files to their telework site for the anticipated day(s) the ODS may be closed)."
"In such circumstances, managers may authorize an employee who is not in their ODS to travel on administrative time (duty/work time) to their ODS to obtain necessary work equipment or files to become telework-ready."
"Example 1: Max, a revenue officer, is away from the ODS making field calls when a weather forecast predicts a snowstorm is approaching that might cause the office to close the next day(s)."
"Max doesn’t typically take their laptop or work files into the field, so Max is not telework-ready."
Max contacts the manager who recommends Max end field calls early and travel to the ODS on administrative time (duty/work time) to gather work equipment and files prior to the end of the TOD.
This ensures Max is telework-ready the following day(s) if the ODS closes.
Example 2: Pat teleworks one day a week and is teleworking when an ice storm prediction comes in for the area.
"Pat anticipates the ODS may be closed the following day(s), but Pat only brought enough work home for one day of telework."
Pat contacts the manager who authorizes Pat to travel from the telework site to the ODS on administrative time (duty/work time) to pick up additional work in the event the office closes the following day(s).
"For a manager to decide whether the exceptions in IRM 6.630.4.5.1(1)(a) or IRM 6.630.4.5.1(1)(b) above apply, the manager must evaluate whether the weather or safety-related conditions outlined in IRM 6.630.4.5(1) could have been reasonably anticipated and whether the employee took reasonable steps (within the employee’s control) to prepare to perform telework at the approved telework site."
"For example, if a significant snowstorm is predicted, the employee may need to prepare by taking home any equipment (for example, laptop computer) and work needed for teleworking."
"To the extent an employee is unable to perform work at a telework site because of their failure to make necessary preparations for reasonably anticipated conditions, a manager may not approve WSL."
"The employee is then required to use personal leave, other paid time off (such as previously earned credit hours or compensatory time) or LWOP."
(Refer to 5 CFR 630.1605(a)(3).)
Unscheduled telework hours worked due to a weather or safety-related office closure or unscheduled telework announcement will not count against the employee’s maximum number of telework hours permitted under their telework agreement.
"The unscheduled telework day will count toward the two-day per pay period requirement to report to the ODS (that is, the POD)."
"Refer to IRM 6.800.2, Employee Benefits, IRS Telework Program."
An employee who is required to telework will not have their previously scheduled telework days changed or cancelled.
"An employee on WSL for consecutive days must respond to management attempts to contact them provided services (such as email, telephone, mobile phone (work or personal)) are available."
The employee is expected to respond within 24 hours.
"6.630.4.5.2 (04-24-2020)
Emergency Employees
Management may designate emergency employees who are critical to IRS operations and for whom WSL may not be applicable."
"To the extent practicable, the manager should inform an employee of their designation as an emergency employee well in advance in anticipation of the possible occurrence of the conditions set forth in IRM 6.630.4.5(1) above."
(Refer to 5 CFR 630.1603.).
"If the manager wishes to provide for the possibility that an emergency employee could work from an approved telework site in lieu of traveling to the regular work site (for example, ODS) in appropriate circumstances, the manager should encourage the employee to enter into a telework agreement providing for that contingency."
Different emergency employees may be designated for different circumstances expected to arise from these conditions.
(Refer to 5 CFR 630.1605(b).)
"An emergency employee must report to work at their regular worksite (for example, ODS) or another approved location as directed by the manager, unless:
The manager determines that travel to or performing work at the worksite is unsafe for the emergency employee, in which case the employee may be required to work at another location, including a telework site as provided above, as appropriate (per 5 CFR 630.1605(b)(1)); or
The manager determines that circumstances justify granting WSL to the emergency employee (per 5 CFR 1605(b(2))."
"6.630.4.5.3 (05-08-2023)
Administration of WSL
The minimum time-charge increment for WSL is 15 minutes."
(Refer to 5 CFR 630.1606(a).)
An employee may be granted WSL only for hours within the employee’s TOD.
"For a full-time employee, that tour is the 40-hour basic workweek as defined in 5 CFR 610.102 or the basic work requirement established for an employee on an AWS as defined in 5 USC 6121(3)."
(Refer to 5 CFR 630.1606(b).)
"An employee may not receive WSL for hours during which they are on preapproved leave (paid or unpaid), other paid time off (such as credit hours, compensatory time and time off award hours) or AWOL."
"There is an exception only if the preapproved leave/other paid time off is frustrated by the emergency conditions, causing the employee to request cancellation of the leave or other paid time off."
"Managers should not approve WSL for an employee who, in their judgment, is cancelling preapproved leave or other paid time off or requesting to change an RDO under an AWS for the primary purpose of obtaining WSL."
"Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.5, Preapproved Leave or Other Paid Time Off, and 5 CFR 630.1606(c) for more information."
"An employee, who is requesting WSL for a period they are expected to work or for a period they were scheduled to use leave or other paid time off, must provide either optional Form 10837, Request for Weather and Safety Leave Due to Emergency Conditions, or other documentation supporting their claim to their manager."
"Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.10, WSL Requests and Documentation Requirements, for more information."
"6.630.4.5.4 (05-08-2023)
Emergency Dismissals and Office Closures - Office Operating Status Announcements
When it becomes necessary to close an office because of weather or other safety-related conditions (for example, an act of God, terrorist attack, or another condition that prevents an employee or group of employees from safely traveling to or safely performing work at an approved location), reasonable efforts will be made to inform all employees via the AtHoc emergency alert notification system, private or public media, including email, the IRS Emergency Hotline, and other methods as appropriate and available."
Such notice will be made as soon as practicable.
"Per IRM 1.2.2.7.6, Delegation Order 6-7, Temporary Office Closures Due to Inclement Weather, Imminent Health and Safety Issues, or Other Emergency Situations, SCR/Commissioner Representatives, site coordinators (campus locations) and executives serving as SCRs have the delegated authority to close offices and dismiss employees for short periods due to severe weather or other emergency conditions."
"The SCRs (or other authorized officials) may declare offices to be:
Open;
Open with the option for unscheduled telework or unscheduled leave;
Open with a delayed arrival time;
Open with an early departure; or
Closed for the entire day."
"An employee who participates in the IRS Telework Program and who has the necessary equipment and work files to perform work at the telework site (that is, who is telework-ready) is generally expected to telework during such emergencies, reducing the need for WSL."
"The IRS emergency telework policy is contained in IRM 6.800.2, Employee Benefits, IRS Telework Program, and negotiated agreement provisions (for BU employees) are contained in Article 50 of the National Agreement."
An employee with a telework agreement is permitted to telework even if there are dependents/family at the telework site.
"However, any interruptions or time spent giving care to such individuals during the employee’s TOD will not be considered hours of work, and WSL will not be granted for that period of time."
The employee is expected to account for such non-work hours as soon as practicable with appropriate personal leave (paid or unpaid) or other paid time off.
Refer to Dependent Care in IRM 6.800.2 for more information.
An employee in travel status (on official travel) during working hours continues working when there is an office operating status announcement affecting their ODS.
"However, if the emergency makes it impossible for the employee to safely work or perform other duties, they must contact their manager as early as practicable to explain the circumstances and for the manager to determine if WSL may be granted."
"Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.10, WSL Requests and Documentation Requirements, for more information."
"The following instructions for each office operating status announcement apply in general, but they may not cover every possible scenario/contingency."
"Refer to the IRS Dismissal and Closure Procedures at: https://irsgov.sharepoint.com/sites/EmployeeResources/Shared%20Documents/IRS-Dismissal-Closure-Procedures.pdf#search=IRS%20Dismissal%20and%20Closure%20Procedures for comprehensive guidance, including frequently asked questions."
"6.630.4.5.4.1 (05-08-2023)
Office is Open
When an office operating status announcement is “Open,” “Open with option for unscheduled telework or unscheduled leave,” or “Open with delayed arrival with option for unscheduled telework or unscheduled leave,” an employee who is scheduled to work in the ODS is expected to report consistent with the office operating status announcement."
"An employee who is scheduled to work in an “open” ODS but who cannot report due to weather or other safety-related conditions, may be eligible for WSL."
Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.4.5 below for more information.
"6.630.4.5.4.2 (05-08-2023)
Office is Open with Option for Unscheduled Telework or Unscheduled Leave
When the option for unscheduled telework or unscheduled leave is provided via office operating status announcement, an employee who is otherwise expected to report to the office on that day may opt to request unscheduled telework (if they participate in the IRS Telework Program and if they have necessary equipment and work), or they may request unscheduled leave (paid or unpaid) or other paid time off (such as previously earned credit hours or compensatory time)."
"If opting for unscheduled telework or unscheduled leave, the day will count toward the two-day per pay period in-office reporting requirement that applies to employees on IRS telework agreements."
"Refer to IRM 6.800.2, Employee Benefits, IRS Telework Program, for more information."
"Note: If the unscheduled telework or unscheduled leave option is not provided by an office operating status announcement and an employee on an IRS telework agreement requests to perform unscheduled telework that day, they must still meet the two-day per pay period in-office reporting requirement and may need to reschedule their in-office day."
"6.630.4.5.4.3 (05-08-2023)
Office is Open with Delayed Arrival
When the office operating status announcement is “Open with delayed arrival” (either by number of hours or actual clock time (for example, two hours or 10:00 a.m.)), then:
WSL is granted up until the time of the delayed arrival only to an employee scheduled to report to the ODS who reports for duty."
The intent of WSL is to allow time for safe travel to the office when a weather or other safety-related condition prevents an employee or group of employees from safely traveling to work.
"An employee scheduled to work in the ODS, who is unable to report at the delayed arrival time because the weather or other safety-related condition made travel to the ODS unsafe, may be eligible for an additional, limited amount of WSL for part or all of their workday."
The employee is obligated to contact their manager as early as practicable to explain the circumstances and provide an estimated time of arrival at work.
"An employee requesting WSL for a period they are expected to work must provide either optional Form 10837, Request for Weather and Safety Leave Due to Emergency Conditions, or other documentation supporting their claim to their manager."
"Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.10, WSL Requests and Documentation Requirements, for more information."
A telework employee who was scheduled to report to the ODS may request unscheduled telework for their entire TOD or may arrive at the delayed arrival time to complete their TOD at the ODS.
"For example, the ODS has a delayed arrival set for 9:30 a.m."
"The telework employee, whose TOD begins at 7:30 a.m., may request unscheduled telework for the entire day and start work at 7:30 a.m. at the telework site, or they may report to the ODS as previously scheduled and begin work in the ODS at 9:30 a.m., receiving two hours of WSL."
"An employee who is scheduled to telework is expected to begin work on time and does not receive WSL for the time approved for the delayed arrival unless they are experiencing an emergency condition (for example, evacuation order, flooding, or roof collapse) at the telework site that prevents them from safely working."
The employee must contact their manager as soon as practical to explain the circumstances.
The manager will determine if WSL may be granted and will provide further instructions.
"Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.8, Emergency at the Telework Site, and IRM 6.630.4.5.10, WSL Requests and Documentation, for more information."
"The standard day shift start time for an employee on a gliding flexible work schedule is considered 7:30 a.m. for purposes of determining the amount of WSL that may be granted, unless the employee and their manager have agreed to a different start time and such an agreement is memorialized in writing (for example, email, memorandum, or letter)."
An employee who is scheduled to use leave (paid or unpaid) or other paid time off (such as credit hours or compensatory time) for the entire day generally remains on leave or other paid time off and is not granted WSL.
"However, an employee who is on scheduled leave or other paid time off for the entire day but chooses to come in at the start of their TOD following a delayed arrival, will contact their manager via telephone or will follow any other mutually agreed upon process to advise their manager of their intent to report to the office."
The employee will receive WSL up until the time of the delayed arrival and will have the remainder of the scheduled leave or other paid time off cancelled.
"6.630.4.5.4.4 (05-08-2023)
Office is Open with Early Departure
Employees who participate in the IRS Telework Program (that is, those who have approved telework agreements):
An employee working at the telework site when their ODS closes early (that is, an office operating status announcement is issued for “Open, with early departure”) continues to work their entire TOD."
"The employee is not granted WSL unless a weather or other safety-related condition impacts the telework site and makes it unsafe for them to continue working (for example, evacuation order)."
"If work at the telework site is unsafe, the employee is obligated to contact their manager as early as practicable to explain the circumstances and to receive further instructions."
"Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.8, Emergency at the Telework Site, for more information."
An employee who is working in the office is required to take their equipment and work files to their telework site to finish their TOD.
An employee required to travel to their approved telework site to finish the day teleworking will be granted WSL for the time required to travel that occurs during their regular duty hours.
"Travel time is posted to either OFP Code 990-59511 (Weather and Safety Leave – Office Closed, Severe Weather) or OFP Code 990-59512 (Weather and Safety Leave – Office Closed, Other Building Issue), as appropriate."
An employee who requests to depart prior to the announced early departure time and who does not finish the TOD teleworking may request to use unscheduled leave (paid or unpaid) or other paid time off (such as previously earned credit hours or compensatory time) for the remainder of the TOD.
"Consistent with workload and staffing needs, an employee who anticipates that circumstances could prevent them from safely traveling home if they wait until the departure time set by the office operating status announcement, may be granted WSL from the time they leave work until they arrive at the telework site to finish their TOD teleworking."
"An employee requesting WSL for a period they are expected to work must provide either optional Form 10837, Request for Weather and Safety Leave Due to Emergency Conditions, or other documentation supporting their claim to their manager."
"Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.10, WSL Requests and Documentation, for more information."
"The employee posts travel time that occurs while the office is still open to OFP Code 990-59513 (Weather and Safety Leave – Office Open, Cannot Safely Report) and either OFP Code 990-59511 (Weather and Safety Leave – Office Closed, Severe Weather) or 990-59512 (Weather and Safety Leave – Office Closed, Other Building Issue) for any travel time that occurs after the official departure time."
Example: An ice storm is expected to hit the area late afternoon.
An early departure is formally announced at 2:00 p.m. with the time for dismissal set for 3:00 p.m. A weather alert is received shortly after the early departure announcement reporting that the bridge an employee needs to cross to get home will be closing at 2:30 p.m. due to treacherous conditions.
"The employee, who participates in the IRS Telework Program, requests to leave immediately so they can safely travel home."
"The employee packs up their equipment and work files, and their manager grants them WSL from the time they depart the ODS (2:15 p.m.) until the time they arrive at their approved telework site (3:15 p.m.)."
The employee then finishes the remainder of their TOD (until 4:30 p.m.) working at the telework site.
The employee posts their time as follows: 2:15 p.m. until 3:00 p.m. to 990-59513 (Weather and Safety Leave - Office Open); 3:00 p.m. until 3:15 p.m. to 990-59511 (Weather and Safety leave - Office Closed); and 3:15 p.m. until 4:30 p.m. to regular work time (coded as telework hours).
An employee must complete the remaining hours in their workday by either teleworking or taking leave (paid or unpaid) or other paid time off.
The manager may not extend the workday to account for the travel time to the telework site.
"If there is insufficient time to require an employee to finish their TOD at the telework site, as determined by the manager, the employee may be granted WSL for the period from the departure time to the end of their TOD."
"An employee requesting WSL for a period they are expected to telework must provide either optional Form 10837, Request for Weather and Safety Leave Due to Emergency Conditions, or other documentation supporting their claim to their manager."
"Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.10, WSL Requests and Documentation Requirements, for more information."
"Employees not participating in the IRS Telework Program (that is, those who do not have telework agreements):
An employee who does not participate in the IRS Telework Program and who is working in their ODS up until the time their ODS closes early (that is, an office operating status announcement is issued for “Open, with early departure”) is granted WSL for the period from the departure time to the end of their TOD."
"An employee who requests to depart prior to the early departure time may request unscheduled leave (paid or unpaid) or other paid time off (such as previously earned credit hours or compensatory time) for the remainder of the day and, generally, does not receive WSL."
"Consistent with workload and staffing needs, an employee who anticipates that circumstances could prevent them from safely traveling home if they wait until the early departure time set by the office operating status announcement, may be granted WSL from the time they leave work through the remainder of the TOD."
"An employee requesting WSL for a period they are expected to work must provide either optional Form 10837, Request for Weather and Safety Leave Due to Emergency Conditions, or other documentation supporting their claim to their manager."
"Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.10, WSL Requests and Documentation, for more information."
"If approved, the employee posts WSL to OFP Code 990-59513 (Weather and Safety Leave – Office Open, Cannot Safely Report) for the absence prior to the time set for dismissal."
"The employee posts either OFP Code 990-59511 (Weather and Safety Leave – Office Closed, Severe Weather) or 990-59512 (Weather and Safety Leave – Office Closed, Other Building Issue) for the time after the official dismissal, as appropriate."
"Example 1: Torrential rains are hitting the area, and news alerts indicate the road where an employee lives will be closed shortly due to flooding."
"To ensure the employee can safely travel home, the manager may grant them WSL to depart the ODS prior to the time set for early dismissal."
The early departure announcement was made at 2:00 p.m. with an early dismissal time of 3:00 p.m.
The employee leaves the office at 2:15 p.m. in order to arrive home before the road closure.
"They post 990-59513 (Weather and Safety Leave - Office Open) from 2:15 p.m. until 3:00 p.m. and post 990-59511 (Weather and Safety Leave – Office Closed, Severe Weather) for the remainder of their TOD."
"Example 2: Heavy snow is starting to fall and at 2:00 p.m., an early dismissal is announced with the time of departure set for 3:00 p.m. An employee requests WSL to depart the office at 2:00 p.m., citing the need to stop at the grocery store to stock up on food and pick up a prescription before going home."
"In such a case, WSL is not appropriate; however, the manager may approve other leave (paid or unpaid) or other paid time off (such as previously earned credit hours or compensatory time) if the employee requests to depart early."
The employee remains on that leave or paid time off for the remainder of their TOD.
"Employees on preapproved leave (paid or unpaid) or other paid time off (such as previously earned credit hours, previously earned compensatory time, or time-off award hours):
An employee on preapproved leave or other paid time off for the entire day when their ODS has an office operating status announcement of “Open with early departure” is not granted WSL for the early departure hours."
"An employee on preapproved leave or other paid time off for a partial day, who departed prior to the early dismissal time, remains on leave or other paid time off unless they were scheduled to return to work after the early departure time."
"An employee who does not participate in the telework program, posts leave for the time scheduled to be on leave and is granted WSL from the time they were scheduled to return from leave through the rest of their TOD."
A telework employee scheduled to return to work finishes the remainder of their TOD at the telework site and generally does not receive WSL.
"Example 1: A non-telework employee is scheduled for annual leave to attend their child’s school play from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. At 2:00 p.m., an early dismissal is announced for their ODS with immediate departure."
The employee would have returned to work at 3:00 p.m. but for the early dismissal.
The employee posts annual leave from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. and posts WSL from 3:00 p.m. until the end of their TOD.
"Example 2: A telework employee, in the same scenario as Example 1, is required to finish their TOD teleworking upon their return from leave if they are telework-ready (that is, has the necessary equipment and work files at their telework site) and is not prevented from safely working at the telework site."
"If not telework-ready, or if prevented from safely working at the telework site, the employee may be granted an equivalent amount of WSL (that is, from 3:00 p.m. until the end of their TOD)."
"An employee working in the office who has leave or other paid time off scheduled to begin at the start of the early departure time, or thereafter, but who no longer requires it because its intended purpose is frustrated (for example, a cancelled medical appointment or a cancelled flight to a vacation destination), may cancel the leave or other paid time off and receive the same amount of WSL that is granted to other employees in the office."
The employee must provide their manager with documentation to show that granting WSL is appropriate.
"Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.10, WSL Requests and Documentation, for more information."
"6.630.4.5.4.5 (04-24-2020)
Office is Open, but Employee Cannot Report
When the ODS is open, an employee who is scheduled to work in the ODS is expected to report."
"An employee scheduled to work in the ODS who is prevented from safely traveling to work due to weather or other safety-related condition, may be eligible for a limited amount of WSL for part or all of their workday."
The employee is obligated to contact their manager as early as practicable to explain the circumstances and provide an estimated time of arrival at work.
"An employee requesting WSL for a period they are expected to work must provide either optional Form 10837, Request for Weather and Safety Leave Due to Emergency Conditions, or other documentation supporting their claim to their manager."
"Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.10, WSL Requests and Documentation, for more information."
"A manager will consider the following factors when determining if an employee will be granted WSL and uniformly apply them to all employees requesting WSL within the area affected by the weather or other safety-related condition:
The ability to telework, if participating in the IRS Telework Program;
The employee resides within, or travels through, an area affected by the weather or other safety-related condition;
The mode of transportation normally used by or reasonably available to the employee;
Efforts taken by the employee to come to work;
The success of other similarly-situated employees;
Any physical disability of the employee; and
Any local travel restrictions or evacuation orders."
"In cases where the office is open and the office operating status announcement does not provide the option for unscheduled telework, an employee may, if participating in the IRS Telework Program, request to telework (if they have necessary equipment and work files)."
"If approved, the employee must still meet the two-day per pay period in-office reporting requirement and may need to reschedule their in-office day."
"Refer to IRM 6.800.2, Employee Benefits, IRS Telework Program, for more information."
"If employees are unable to report due to a declared disaster area, refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.7, Major Disaster Declarations, below."
"6.630.4.5.4.6 (05-08-2023)
Office is Closed
Employees participating in the IRS Telework Program:
A telework employee, who is either scheduled to telework or who is not scheduled to telework but is telework-ready, is expected to telework when their ODS is closed."
"The employee is expected to begin work on time, work their entire TOD, and does not receive WSL unless, in the manager’s judgment:

• The weather or other safety-related condition could not reasonably be anticipated, and the employee is otherwise unable to perform productive work at the telework site; or
• The employee is prevented from safely working at the approved telework site due to circumstances arising from the weather or other safety-related condition applicable to the telework site."
Exception: WSL may not be granted to a telework employee who is approved for the temporary exception to the 200-mile radius for telework site benefit (permitted for up to two pay periods per CY under Article 50 of the National Agreement (for BU employees) and passed-through to NBU employees in the Consolidated National Agreement “Pass-Through” Provisions found at: https://irsgov.sharepoint.com/sites/EmployeeResources/SitePages/EmployeeRightsAndObligations71.aspx).
"If unable to telework, an employee using this benefit is required to use their own personal leave, other paid time off (such as previously earned credit hours or compensatory time) or LWOP."
This WSL prohibition does not apply to an employee who is approved to telework outside the 200-mile radius due to an approved hardship or approved reasonable accommodation.
"In making the determination in (1)(a) above, the manager must evaluate whether the weather or other safety-related condition could be reasonably anticipated and whether the employee took reasonable steps (within the employee’s control) to prepare to perform telework at the approved telework site."
"For example, if a significant snowstorm is predicted, the employee may need to prepare by taking home any equipment (for example, laptop computer) and work needed for teleworking."
Employees not in their ODS who have insufficient work or equipment may be authorized by their manager to travel on administrative time (duty/work time) to their ODS to obtain necessary work equipment or files to become telework-ready.
"To the extent that an employee is unable to perform work at a telework site because of failure to make necessary preparations for reasonably anticipated conditions, a manager may not provide WSL."
(Refer to 5 CFR 630.1605(a)(3).)
"If the employee is not telework-ready for all or part of the TOD when a weather or safety-related condition forces the closure of the IRS facility, and they could not have reasonably anticipated the weather or safety-related condition, the employee may be granted an equivalent amount of WSL."
"Alternatively, an employee may request unscheduled leave (paid or unpaid) or other paid time off (such as previously earned credit hours or compensatory time)."
An employee who is prevented from safely working at the telework site is obligated to contact their manager as early as practicable to explain the circumstances.
"An employee requesting WSL for a period they are expected to telework must provide either optional Form 10837, Request for Weather and Safety Leave Due to Emergency Conditions, or other documentation supporting their claim to their manager."
"Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.10, WSL Requests and Documentation, for more information."
"Employees not participating in the IRS Telework Program (that is, those who do not have telework agreements) will be granted WSL for the entire TOD if scheduled to work that day (that is, not on preapproved leave (paid or unpaid) or other paid time off (such as credit hours or compensatory time)."
"Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.5, Preapproved Leave or Other Paid Time Off, for more information."
"An employee on WSL for consecutive days is expected to respond to management attempts to contact them within 24 hours provided services (such as email, telephone, mobile phone (work or personal)) are available."
"6.630.4.5.5 (05-08-2023)
Preapproved Leave or Other Paid Time Off
An employee may not receive WSL for hours during which they are on other preapproved leave (paid or unpaid) or other paid time off (such as previously earned credit hours or compensatory time)."
(Refer to 5 CFR 630.1606(c).)
"An employee who is requesting, in the manager’s judgment, to cancel preapproved leave (paid or unpaid) or other paid time off for the primary purpose of obtaining WSL should remain on leave or other paid time off and is not provided WSL."
"However, when the weather or other safety condition prevents the use of the preapproved leave (paid or unpaid) or other paid time off for its intended purpose, it may be cancelled upon providing the manager with appropriate documentation."
"If the employee is not participating in the IRS Telework Program, they may be provided WSL."
"If the employee is participating in the IRS Telework Program, they would generally be expected to telework; however, they may also cancel preapproved leave or other paid time off and be granted the same amount of WSL as other employees if:
The intended purpose of the leave or other paid time off is frustrated by the same weather and safety-related condition forcing the office closure; and
The employee is not telework-ready."
The manager should request information or documentation to show that granting WSL is appropriate.
Example 1: An employee is on vacation in a distant location when offices are closed.
Any request to cancel preapproved leave or other paid time off would be for the purpose of obtaining WSL because the employee is not available to work at the ODS and is not affected by the weather or safety-related emergency.
"Therefore, any request to cancel such leave or other paid time off may not be approved."
"Example 2: An employee is in the middle of a six-week period of scheduled, unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act to recover from a serious illness."
"This employee has no intention to report to work on the day of a weather or safety-related emergency, and if such an employee requested to cancel the unpaid leave on the day of the emergency, it would clearly be for the primary purpose of obtaining WSL."
"Therefore, any such request for WSL may not be approved."
Example 3: An employee is unable to leave for a planned vacation because flights are suddenly cancelled due to a weather or safety-related emergency.
The employee may cancel their preapproved leave or other paid time off as the cancellation is not for the primary purpose of obtaining WSL.
"If IRS offices are closed and the employee is participating in the IRS Telework Program, they would be expected to telework, if telework-ready."
"If the employee is not participating in the IRS Telework Program, or if they are but are not telework-ready, they may be provided WSL."
"If offices are open or operating on delayed arrival that day, the employee would follow normal procedures based on the office operating status announcement."
"If an employee is scheduled to use sick leave for a medical appointment and the appointment is cancelled due to a weather or safety-related condition, the legal basis for the sick leave has been eliminated, and the sick leave must be cancelled."
"The employee must account for the hours by requesting to charge them to another type of leave (for example, annual leave, LWOP, WSL (if appropriate)) or to other paid time off, or the employee may, if participating in the IRS Telework Program, request to perform unscheduled telework."
"An employee who requests cancellation of preapproved leave and substitution of WSL may use optional Form 10837, Request for Weather and Safety Leave Due to Emergency Conditions, or provide other documentation to their manager."
"Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.10, WSL Requests and Documentation, for more information."
"6.630.4.5.6 (04-24-2020)
Changes to AWS
A manager should not approve WSL for an employee who, in the manager’s judgment, is changing their AWS RDO for the primary purpose of obtaining WSL."
(Refer to 5 CFR 630.1606(c).)
An employee does not receive an “in-lieu-of” AWS day off when a closure occurs on their scheduled RDO.
The RDO is treated the same as any other non-workday (Saturday and Sunday for most employees).
"Refer to IRM 6.610.1, IRS Hours of Duty, and additionally for BU employees, Article 23 of the National Agreement for more information regarding when changes may be made to an RDO."
"Should any of the instructions in the IRM conflict with the National Agreement, the Agreement prevails for BU employees."
"6.630.4.5.7 (04-24-2020)
Major Disaster Declarations
When a disaster area has been declared by the President, OPM or other appropriate authority, a request for WSL beyond what may have been granted by the IRS through office operating status announcement and/or OPM based on safety considerations, may be submitted by an employee."
"An employee’s request will be reviewed and approved or disapproved on a case-by-case basis through the management chain by a designated business unit executive as follows:
The employee must be unable to safely report to work and, if participating in the IRS Telework Program, unable to safely telework due to the disaster, and the inability to report to work or telework is beyond their control."
Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.4.5 for the various factors that will be considered.
The ability of the employee to safely report to another POD on a temporary basis may also be considered.
"An employee requesting WSL for a period they are expected to work must provide either optional Form 10837, Request for Weather and Safety Leave Due to Emergency Conditions, or other documentation supporting their claim to their manager."
"Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.10, WSL Requests and Documentation, for more information."
"Requests for WSL that are related to a disaster declaration will be reviewed and approved or disapproved through the management chain by a designated business unit executive, in consultation and coordination with the SCR and the local labor relations specialist(s) for the geographic area(s) of the disaster."
This is to ensure consistent approval or disapproval of these requests across business unit lines.
"Refer to IRM 1.2.2.7.9, Delegation Order 6-12, Absence and Leave."
"Workplace flexibilities that can assist an employee when a disaster strikes include:
Temporarily modified TOD (subject to the provisions of IRM 6.610.1, IRS Hours of Duty, and for BU employees, Article 23 of the National Agreement);
Unscheduled telework;
Unscheduled leave;
Earning or using of credit hours to adjust work schedules;
Advanced annual leave; and
LWOP."
The Emergency Leave Transfer Program (ELTP) can provide an employee additional time off to attend to personal matters resulting from a disaster emergency.
"If an ELTP is established, an employee may apply for donated annual leave."
"Additional information on the ELTP is found on IRS Source at: https://irsgov.sharepoint.com/sites/EmployeeResources/SitePages/Timekeeping3.aspx and in IRM 6.630.1, Absence and Leave."
"The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is a no-cost, confidential counseling service available to assist an employee and their family in difficult situations."
A manager may contact the EAP to request a critical incident stress debriefing for traumatic events that impact their workgroup.
Services are available via the toll-free number 800-977-7631.
"Information on the EAP (including the mobile app) is found on IRS Source at: https://irsgov.sharepoint.com/sites/EmployeeResources/SitePages/EAP.aspx; in IRM 6.800.3, Employee Assistance and Worklife Referral Program; and additionally for BU employees, in Article 27 of the National Agreement."
"Additional disaster emergency guidance for managers and employees may be extended through IRS communication channels including the Office of the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioners, or IRS Human Capital Officer for incidents that impact significant portions of the IRS for an extensive period (for example, hurricanes, wild fires, pandemics)."
A manager can also refer to iManage at: https://irsgov.sharepoint.com/sites/iManage for more disaster guidance.
"6.630.4.5.8 (05-08-2023)
Emergency at the Telework Site
A teleworking employee who experiences a weather or other safety-related condition (for example, evacuation order, flooding, or roof collapse) that prevents them from safely working at their telework site, must contact their manager as soon as practicable."
"The employee may be directed to travel to the employee’s ODS (or if the employee is NBU, may be directed to an alternative worksite), provided it is open and they may safely travel under the circumstances, to complete their workday."
"If directed to travel during regular duty hours, the employee will receive administrative time (that is, work time) to cover the travel time."
A manager may not extend the workday to account for the travel time to the ODS or alternative worksite.
"Example: A teleworking employee, whose TOD is 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., is directed to the ODS at 10:00 a.m. and arrives at 10:30 a.m."
The employee receives administrative time (work time) for the travel from 10:00 a.m. until 10:30 a.m. and completes their TOD in the ODS at 4:00 p.m.
The manager may not extend the employee’s workday to 4:30 p.m. to account for the travel time to the ODS.
"If the telework employee is not directed by their manager to report to their open ODS the day of the weather or other safety-related condition that prevents their safely working at the telework site, the employee may be granted WSL upon providing appropriate documentation to their manager (refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.8(4) below for an exception to this rule)."
The employee is generally expected to report to the open ODS on subsequent days at the beginning of their TOD until the issue at the telework site is resolved.
"An employee at their approved telework site (or other alternate worksite) who experiences an emergency that prevents them from safely completing their work assignments, and the ODS is closed, may be provided WSL upon providing appropriate documentation in support of that claim."
Exception: WSL may not be granted to a telework employee who is approved for the temporary exception to the 200-mile radius for telework site benefit (permitted for up to two pay periods per CY under Article 50 of the National Agreement (for BU employees) and passed-through to NBU employees in the Consolidated National Agreement “Pass-Through” Provisions found at: https://irsgov.sharepoint.com/sites/EmployeeResources/SitePages/EmployeeRightsAndObligations71.aspx).
"If unable to telework, an employee using this benefit is required to use their own personal leave, other paid time off (such as previously earned credit hours or compensatory time) or LWOP."
This WSL prohibition does not apply to an employee who is approved to telework outside the 200-mile radius due to an approved hardship or approved reasonable accommodation.
"An employee requesting WSL for any period they are expected to telework must provide either optional Form 10837, Request for Weather and Safety Leave Due to Emergency Conditions, or other documentation supporting their claim to their manager."
"Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.10, WSL Requests and Documentation, for more information."
"6.630.4.5.9 (05-08-2023)
WSL for Quarantinable Communicable Diseases
Per OPM memorandum CPM 2020-02 at: https://www.chcoc.gov/content/human-resources-flexibilities-available-federal-employees-impacted-2019-novel-coronavirus, WSL may be authorized when an asymptomatic (that is, healthy, not displaying symptoms of the given disease), non-telework employee is subject to movement restrictions (quarantine) under the direction of public health authorities due to a significant risk of exposure to a quarantinable communicable disease."
This determination is based on the significant safety risks for other employees and the general public that would be incurred if such an employee were allowed to travel to and perform work at the employee’s ODS.
"The employee must provide either optional Form 10837, Request for Weather and Safety Leave Due to Emergency Conditions, or other documentation supporting their claim to their manager."
"Refer to IRM 6.630.4.5.10, WSL Requests and Documentation, for more information."
"A telework participant under the same scenario as IRM 6.630.4.5.9(1) above (that is, asymptomatic and under quarantine at the direction of public health authorities due to significant risk of exposure to a quarantinable communicable disease), does not receive WSL."
A telework employee is generally expected to telework as long as the employee is asymptomatic.
"Quarantinable communicable diseases are specified by Executive Order (for example, Executive Orders 13295, 13375, 13674, and 14047 at: https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/joe-biden/2021."
"Examples of such diseases include:
cholera
diphtheria
infectious tuberculosis
measles
plaque
smallpox
yellow fever
severe acute respiratory syndromes that are causing, or have the potential to cause, a pandemic, or, upon infection, are highly likely to cause mortality or serious morbidity if not properly controlled (such as COVID-19)
An employee who is (or who becomes) symptomatic (ill), is diagnosed as being infected or likely has been infected with a quarantinable disease, is not eligible for WSL."
"If unable to work, accrued or advanced sick leave would normally be used to cover such a period of sickness as provided in 5 CFR 630.401(a)(2) and IRM 6.630.1."
The manager must grant sick leave when an illness prevents an employee from performing work.
"If the employee exhausts their available sick leave, other paid leave (such as annual leave) or other paid time off (such as credit hours or compensatory time) may be available to an employee."
"The granting of WSL is not appropriate in cases of communicable diseases that are not designated as ""quarantinable"" by public health authorities since they do not pose the same high degree of safety risks for the public."
"Examples of such communicable diseases include cold, influenza (flu), strep throat, and chicken pox."
Sick leave is authorized in these circumstances under 5 CFR 630.401(a)(5) and per IRM 6.630.1.
"6.630.4.5.10 (05-08-2023)
WSL Requests and Documentation Requirements
An employee who is requesting WSL due to a weather or safety-related condition or due to quarantinable communicable disease must contact their manager as soon as possible and provide appropriate documentation supporting their claim."
"An employee may use optional Form 10837, Request for Weather and Safety Leave Due to Emergency Conditions, or may use other methods to request WSL and provide the appropriate documentation supporting their claim (for example, email)."
"A manager may, at their discretion, waive the requirement for documentation for WSL requests of four hours or less."
"Per IRM 1.2.2.7.9, Delegation Order 6-12, Absence and Leave, immediate managers are authorized to approve requests for WSL with the exception of those related to a major disaster declaration as outlined in IRM 6.630.4.5.7, Major Disaster Declarations, above."
"Disaster-related WSL requests are reviewed and approved or disapproved through the management chain by a designated business unit executive, in consultation and coordination with the SCR and the local labor relations specialist(s) for the geographic area(s) of the disaster."
This is to ensure consistent approval or disapproval of these requests across business unit lines.
"6.630.4.5.11 (05-08-2023)
Time and Attendance Records and Data System Reporting
Records: Accurate records of the placement of an employee on WSL must be maintained."
(Refer to 5 CFR 630.1607(a).)
"Reporting: In IRS data systems (including the time and attendance system) and in data reports submitted to OPM, WSL granted under 5 USC 6329c and 5 CFR 630, Subpart P, must be reported as a category of leave separate from other types of leave."
(Refer to 5 CFR 630.1607(b).)
"Time and Attendance: To comply with statutory and regulatory reporting requirements, a manager must ensure an accurate accounting of when an employee is provided WSL."
A manager must approve or disapprove requests for WSL promptly upon review of documentation submitted by the employee.
Any WSL granted must be posted in 15-minute increments.
"A manager and employee posting WSL to the time and attendance system should review Exhibit 6.630.4-1, WSL Time and Attendance Reporting Codes and Descriptions."
Additional leave OFP codes and other timekeeping information may be found on the IRS Source Timekeeping Help webpage at: https://irsgov.sharepoint.com/sites/EmployeeResources/SitePages/Timekeeping-Help.aspx.
A leave discrepancy that requires a correction may result in a debt.
"IRM 6.630.1, Absence and Leave, contains important information regarding time and attendance records."
"IRM 1.15, Records and Information Management, and Document 12829, General Records Schedule, contain important information regarding record retention requirements."

"6.630.5.1.6 (08-26-2025)
Terms
Adoption: Legal process in which an individual becomes the legal parent of another's child."
"The source of an adopted child – for example, whether from a licensed placement agency or otherwise – is not a factor in determining eligibility of leave or other programs."
"Advanced Leave: Annual leave and/or sick leave hours that may be granted to an employee prior to accruing them, upon request and after submitting supporting documentation, as appropriate."
"See IRM 6.630.5.6, Advanced Leave for Childbirth, Adoption, and Foster Care."
"For more information on advanced leave in general, see IRM 6.630.1.6, Advanced Leave."
"Annual Leave: Hours accrued for federal service that may be used for vacations, rest and relaxation, and personal business or emergencies."
"Any 12-month period: For purposes of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) entitlement, this is the 12-month period beginning on the date of birth or placement of the child’s birth, adoption, or foster care placement."
"Or, in the case of a serious medical condition of the employee or family member, the 12-month period begins on the date an employee first takes leave under the FMLA for an approved FMLA need and continues for 12 months."
An employee may use only 12 weeks of FMLA leave in any 12-month period.
Use of FMLA (for other purposes during the 12-month period) will reduce the amount of FMLA an employee may substitute for paid parental leave (PPL).
"In the case of the death of an employee’s child, the 12-month period begins on the date of the child’s death."
Birth: The delivery of a living child.
"When the term “birth” is used in connection with the use of leave before birth, it refers to an anticipated birth."
PPL may not be granted based on an anticipated birth or placement.
"Certain military service: Honorable active service in the Army, Army National Guard, Navy, Air Force, Air National Guard, Space Force, or Marine Corps of the United States, or service on active duty or full-time National Guard duty."
"Child: A person who is under the care or guardianship of a parent through birth (biological), adopted or foster child, stepchild, a legal ward, or a person standing in loco parentis who is under 18 years of age; or 18 years of age or older and incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability."
"Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA): A federal law that entitles most federal employees to a total of up to 12 workweeks (480 hours) of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for serious health conditions, such as incapacity due to pregnancy, childbirth, care for the newborn child and for new adoption or foster care placement of a child."
The amount of FMLA leave used within the 12-month period will reduce the amount of PPL available for birth or placement purposes.
"For example, the use of FMLA leave for a serious health condition during a 12-month FMLA period may reduce the PPL available for birth or placement purposes within a calendar year of when the employee initially invoked FMLA."
"See IRM 6.630.1.9, Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), for more information."
"FMLA-eligible employee: An employee who is covered by the federal leave system under the authority in 5 USC and meets the following eligibility requirements under the FMLA:
Has completed 12 consecutive or nonconsecutive months of federal service."
"Has a part-time or full-time work scheduled (i.e., employees with an intermittent work schedule are ineligible)."
"Has an appointment of more than one year in duration (i.e., employees with temporary appointments not-to-exceed one year are ineligible)."
"Federal civilian service: Service of a type that is covered under the title 5, United States Code, FMLA provisions."
"Foster care: Care for a child in substitution for, and away from, their parent(s) or guardian(s) that lasts at least 24-hours."
"Such placement, made by or with the agreement of the state, includes a voluntary agreement by the parent or guardian that the child be removed from the home and an agreement between the state and foster family to take the child."
"Although foster care may be with relatives of the child, state action is involved in the removal of the child from parental custody."
Leave Sharing Program: Benefit programs to include the Leave Bank Program and Leave Transfer Program that permit employees who do not have available paid leave to use donated annual leave when they have a personal or family medical emergency.
"See IRM 6.630.1.11, Leave Sharing Program, for more information."
Leave Year: The period beginning on the first day of the first full biweekly pay period (PP) in a calendar year and ending on the day immediately before the first day of the first full biweekly PP in the following calendar year.
"See IRM 6.630.1, IRS Absence and Leave, for more information."
Paid Parental Leave (PPL): Paid time off that any eligible employee may substitute for unpaid FMLA for purposes relating to spending time with a child (bonding) after birth or new child placement (adoption or foster care).
"The employee must have a current parental role in connection with the birth of their child, adoption, and/or foster care placement."
"Parent: A person who is the guardian of a child through birth (biological), adoptive, step, or foster care placement."
Placement: A new placement of a child with an employee for adoption or foster care.
The adoption of a stepchild or a foster child who has already been a member of the employee's household and has an existing parent-child relationship with an adopting parent is excluded.
"Sick Leave: A paid absence from duty that an employee is entitled to use for personal medical needs, family care or bereavement, care of a family member with a serious health condition or a communicable disease, and adoption-related purposes."
"See IRM 6.630.1.5, Sick Leave, for more information."

Leave for Birth, Adoption and Foster Care Placement of a Child
There are various leave options available for pregnancy, birth, placement and care of a child, as well as additional benefits for family purposes."
"Any employee, regardless of sex, who experiences a birth, adoption, or foster care placement and meets eligibility requirements, may request to use the following leave types:
PPL as a paid substitution for FMLA-LWOP;
Accrued annual and/or sick leave;
Advanced annual and/or sick leave;
FMLA-LWOP;
LWOP;
Donated annual leave under the voluntary leave transfer and leave bank programs."
The employee must meet eligibility requirements to use the leave requested.
"6.630.5.3 (08-26-2025)
Paid Parental Leave (PPL)
The PPL benefit is available to federal employees experiencing a birth, adoption, and/or foster care placement occurring on or after October 1, 2020."
"All eligible employees covered by the FMLA, regardless of sex, are entitled to request and use up to 12 administrative workweeks (480 hours) of PPL, as a substitute for unpaid FMLA leave in connection with the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child under 5 USC 6382, and 5 CFR 630.1703."
The number of hours available for part-time employees will be prorated.
"An employee cannot use 12 administrative workweeks (480 hours) of PPL and then an additional 12 administrative workweeks (480 hours) of unpaid FMLA leave, or vice versa, during the same 12-month period following the birth, adoption, or foster care placement."
An employee cannot be required to use accrued annual or sick leave before using PPL (but an employee may request to do so) and managers cannot deduct PPL from an employee’s accrued leave balances.
An employee may decline the use of PPL and elect to use unpaid FMLA leave.
"6.630.5.3.1 (08-26-2025)
General Eligibility
Any fulltime employee, regardless of sex, is eligible to request and use up to 12 administrative workweeks (480 hours) of PPL during a 12-month period beginning on the date of the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child occurring October 1, 2020, or later, if they are covered by the federal leave system under the authority in 5 USC 6381 and meet the following eligibility requirements under the FMLA:
Have completed 12 consecutive or nonconsecutive months of federal service, or a combination of certain military service and federal civilian service that equates to at least 12 months (see Terms for definitions of “certain military service” and “federal civilian service”); and
Have an appointment of more than one year in duration."
Employees on a temporary or intermittent appointment are not eligible.
Part-time employees are eligible for a prorated amount of PPL calculated in the same manner as for prorated FMLA.
"See IRM 6.630.1.9.1, FMLA-Description, which states, ""An eligible part-time employee is entitled to a prorated amount of unpaid FMLA leave, which may not exceed an amount equal to 12 times the average number of hours in their scheduled tour of duty (TOD) each week (for example, 20 hours per workweek X 12 = 240 FMLA hours)."""
The PPL may not be applied on a holiday or any other nonwork day when the employee would be excused from duty.
"Seasonal employees, who meet eligibility requirements are entitled to PPL when in work status."
Seasonal employees cannot use PPL as a basis for extending their work season.
"An employee who is ineligible for FMLA at the time of a birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child occurring October 1, 2020, or later, may establish FMLA eligibility during the 12-month period following the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child and use PPL during that period."
"Example: If all other eligibility requirements are met, an employee may become eligible for FMLA by completing the required 12 months of federal service or by changing to a qualifying work schedule or appointment."
"Once FMLA eligibility is established and FMLA is invoked, an employee may be able to substitute PPL in connection with a birth or placement during the 12-month period following the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child."
"When eligible parents are both employed by the federal government, each has a separate entitlement to PPL; however, one parent may not transfer any portion of their entitlement to the other parent."
"6.630.5.3.2 (08-26-2025)
Interactions Between PPL and FMLA
PPL is substituted for unpaid leave under FMLA; therefore, the use of FMLA leave for purposes other than the birth or placement of a child, (such as leave based on a serious health condition) during a 12-month FMLA period may reduce the PPL available for birth or placement purposes."
"See IRM 6.630.1.9, Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), for more information on FMLA leave."
Example: An employee expects the birth of their child in March 2021.
"The employee’s parent is in a serious car accident on November 1, 2020, and the employee invokes FMLA on this date."
"As a result, the employee uses 280 hours of FMLA leave beginning on November 1 (to care for a family member with a serious health condition) while their parent is hospitalized and then caring for them at home when they cannot care for themselves."
"When the employee’s baby arrives on March 30, 2021, they would only have 200 hours remaining under FMLA through October 31, 2021."
"However, the employee may take the additional 280 hours of PPL (as a substitute for unpaid FMLA leave) after October 31, 2021, as long as they do so before March 29, 2022 (within 12 months of the applicable birth)."
"An employee may not use PPL before the birth or placement of a child, even if an employee used unpaid FMLA leave for birth or placement purposes prior to the birth or placement event."
"Example: An employee is on medically prescribed bed rest for three weeks prior to the birth of their child and wishes to take time off from work for this purpose from January 1, 2021, through January 22, 2021."
The employee cannot use PPL since the child has not yet been born.
"The employee invokes FMLA for a serious health condition (bed rest) on January 1, 2021, and uses 120 hours of unpaid FMLA leave until their child is born on January 23, 2021."
"Beginning January 23, 2021, the employee substitutes the additional 360 hours of PPL available under the 480-hour FMLA entitlement."
"Once the employee’s invoked FMLA for a serious health condition expires on December 31, 2021 (12 months after the start date), they can use the remaining 120 hours of PPL, between January 1, 2022, through January 22, 2022 (within 12 months of the applicable birth)."
"6.630.5.3.3 (08-26-2025)
Care of a Child
To use PPL, in addition to meeting the definition of a parent under the FMLA, an employee must also be caring for a newly born or newly placed child, in the home with the child or otherwise involved in spending time with the child, acting in a parental role and engaged in activities directly connected with the care of the child whose birth or placement triggered the PPL entitlement such as parent-child bonding."
"Caring for a newly born or placed child may include short periods away from the child’s physical presence to purchase supplies needed to support the care for the child, such as buying baby food, diapers, or other supplies."
It may also include circumstances where the newborn or newly placed child is in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) or is hospitalized.
A parent would not be considered caring for the child if they are physically located outside the local geographic area where the child is located and not engaged in activities directly connected to the care of the child.
"For example, a biological parent who lives separately from the child must be involved in care activities to be eligible for PPL use."
The PPL may be used for the new placement of a child for adoption or foster care.
"The adoption of a current stepchild or foster child, one who is already a member of the employee’s household with an existing parent-child relationship with an adopting parent, does not qualify for use of PPL."
"6.630.5.3.4 (08-26-2025)
Application Requirements
In order to substitute PPL for unpaid FMLA leave, an employee must invoke FMLA for the birth, adoption or foster care placement of a child in written, oral, or electronic form, as outlined in IRM 6.630.1.9.6, Requirements."
"When an employee requests PPL, they must submit the following completed forms to their approving designated management official before they intend to begin using PPL:
Form 9611-A Paid Parental Leave (PPL) Request and
Form 9611-B Agreement to Complete 12-Week Work Obligation
The employee must request and use PPL within 12 months of the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child."
"Where the need for PPL is foreseeable, the employee must submit advance notice using Form 9611-A, Paid Parental Leave (PPL) Request, no less than 30 days before PPL is to begin."
"If the need for leave is not foreseeable, such as a medical emergency, unexpected birth of a live child or unexpected availability of a child for adoption or foster care, and the employee cannot provide 30 days’ notice, the employee must provide notice within a reasonable timeframe appropriate to the circumstances involved."
"See IRM 6.630.5.3.10, Cases of Employee Incapacitation for more information."
"Prior to using PPL, the employee must enter into a written service agreement by signing Form 9611-B, Agreement to Complete 12-Week Work Obligation confirming they will return to work for 12 weeks after the PPL period ends or reimburse the IRS the cost of the government's contribution toward their Federal Employee Health Benefits insurance premiums."
"See IRM 6.630.5.3.8, Work Obligation, for more information."
"The employee must provide their approving designated management official with appropriate documentation as outlined in IRM 6.630.5.3.5, Types of Supporting Documentation, to support the use of PPL."
"The approving designated management official for FMLA requests, including PPL requests, is determined by the business unit’s delegation of authority."
"6.630.5.3.5 (08-26-2025)
Types of Supporting Documentation
An employee must provide appropriate documentation to their approving designated management official within 15 calendar days of the approving official’s request, which shows the use of PPL is directly connected to a birth or placement of a child."
"If it is not practical for an employee to respond within the 15-day timeframe, despite the employee’s diligent, good faith efforts, the employee must provide the documentation within a reasonable timeframe, but no later than 30 calendar days after the date of the approving official’s original request."
"Appropriate documentation to support the request to use PPL for childbirth includes:
Birth certificate;
Document naming employee as second parent, such as declaration of paternity or court order of filiation;
Appropriate court documents;
Consular report of birth abroad;
Documentation provided by the child's healthcare provider;
Hospital admission form associated with the delivery; or
Other documentation approved by the IRS."
"Appropriate documentation to support the request to use PPL for adoption includes:
Documentation provided by the adoption agency confirming the placement and date of placement;
Letter signed by the parent's/parents' attorney confirming the placement and date of placement;
Immigrant visa for the child issued by U.S."
"Citizenship and Immigration Services;
Adoptive placement agreement;
Independent adoption placement agreement; or
Other documentation approved by the IRS."
"Appropriate documentation to support the request to use PPL for foster care includes:
Foster care placement record;
Other documentation from the foster agency confirming the placement and date of placement;
Foster care placement letter issued by the relevant local department of social services or authorized voluntary foster care agency; or
Other documentation approved by the IRS."
"Management may grant the use of PPL prior to receiving any requested documentation or certification based on an employee’s communications with management, as appropriate."
The employee’s notice of their intent to take leave may suffice as the employee’s confirmation to invoke their entitlement.
"This granting of PPL is considered to be provisional, pending receipt of the requested documentation and/or certification within 15 calendar days of the request, or 30 calendar days with justification, agreed upon between the employee and their management, as appropriate."
"If the employee fails to provide the required documentation and/or certification within the specified timeframe, the IRS may determine that the employee is not entitled to PPL and may:
Allow the employee to request the absence be charged to LWOP, sick leave, annual leave, or other form of paid time off, as appropriate; or
If the employee acted fraudulently, charge the employee as absent without leave (AWOL) and pursue any other appropriate action."
"Being charged with AWOL can lead to a disciplinary action by the IRS, up to and including removal."
"See IRM 6.630.1.13, Absence Without Leave (AWOL), for more information on AWOL."
"If an employee’s request to use PPL is denied, the approving designated management official will provide the reasons of the denial to the employee in writing."
"For example, if an employee submitted an incomplete PPL request, the approving designated management official would state in writing what additional information is needed to make the request complete."
"It is critical that an employee’s privacy be safeguarded when requesting, receiving, and storing medical documentation."
Information concerning an employee’s medical condition or history should be maintained in a separate confidential medical file.
The presence of medical documentation in an employee performance file (EPF) violates the Rehabilitation Act.
The confidential medical file should always be secured in a locked cabinet.
"For more information regarding the requirements to safeguard medical information, see IRM 10.5.1.2.2, Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) Data."
The approving designated management official will retain the documentation for records maintenance per IRS policy requirements.
"For additional information, see IRM 1.15, Records and Information Management and Document 12829 General Records Schedules."
"6.630.5.3.6 (08-26-2025)
Duration of PPL Benefit
The PPL may not be used before the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child."
"The PPL benefit expires 12 months after the date of the applicable birth, adoption, or foster care placement."
"An employee may elect to substitute PPL for FMLA leave at any time during the 12-month period, beginning on the actual date of the birth or placement of the child."
"If all PPL is not used by the end of the twelfth month following the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child, the employee forfeits any remaining hours."
There are no carryover provisions for unused PPL and an employee may not be paid for unused or expired PPL.
"The PPL is available as long as an employee has a continuing parental role in connection with the child whose birth or placement was the basis for the leave entitlement during the 12-month period, beginning on the actual date of the birth or placement of the child."
"In the unfortunate incident that the child dies while the employee is on PPL, the use of PPL would end."
The employee may request and be approved to use other leave to cover the employee’s absence due to the child’s death.
"Examples of leave the employee may be approved to use are:
Parental bereavement leave as outlined in IRM 6.630.5.8, Parental Bereavement Leave;
Sick leave for general family care or bereavement as outlined in IRM 6.630.1.5.5, Sick Leave for Family Care;
Annual Leave as outlined in IRM 6.630.1.3, Annual Leave;
LWOP as outlined in IRM 6.630.1.10, Leave Without Pay (LWOP); and
Other leave, as appropriate, to account for the absence."
"6.630.5.3.7 (08-26-2025)
Intermittent Use
An employee may request to use PPL intermittently, or on a reduced leave schedule to bond with and/or care for their child."
Approving designated management officials are encouraged to approve requests for intermittent PPL for bonding to the maximum extent practicable to balance the needs of the employee and the IRS.
"An employee must provide dates (actual or estimates) for intermittent use of PPL on Form 9611-A, Paid Parental Leave (PPL) Request."
"6.630.5.3.8 (08-26-2025)
Work Obligation
Prior to being granted approval to use PPL, an employee must agree in writing to return to work for the IRS for 12 weeks beginning on the date on which PPL concludes by submitting Form 9611-B, Agreement to Complete 12-week Work Obligation, to their approving designated management official."
"If an employee is incapacitated and unable to enter into such an agreement, an exception to this rule is provided, as outlined in IRM 6.630.5.3.10, Cases of Employee Incapacitation."
"The date that PPL concludes is:
The workday on which an employee finishes using the 12 workweeks of PPL; or
If the employee uses less than 12 workweeks of PPL during the 12-month period following the birth or placement, the last workday on which the employee used PPL in connection with the given child."
Any periods of work between intermittent use of PPL do not count toward completion of the 12-week work obligation.
The work obligation is met by performing work after the use of PPL concludes.
"For employees charged leave on an hourly basis (to include fractions of an hour), the 12-week work obligation will be converted to hours as it was converted for PPL."
"For example, a full-time employee charged leave on an hourly basis must complete 480 hours of work after the PPL concludes."
The 12-week work obligation includes only those periods during which the employee is in a pay and duty status.
"Any periods of paid or unpaid leave, time off or other periods of nonduty status or intermittent work during the use of PPL, do not count toward completion of the 12-week work obligation."
"Examples of hours which do not count toward the 12-week work obligation are:
Leave (paid or unpaid);
Time off (including holidays);
Furlough;
AWOL."
Any periods in which an employee is in non-duty status or periods of leave taken while in duty status will extend how long it will take for the employee to fulfill the 12-week work obligation.
The 12-week work obligation is statutorily fixed and applies regardless of the actual amount of PPL used.
"For example, an employee who uses less than the full 12 administrative workweek (480 hours) entitlement of PPL is still obligated to work 12 weeks after the day PPL concludes."
An employee who separates from the IRS before completing the 12-week work obligation is considered to have failed to return to duty and the employee will owe a debt to the IRS.
An intra-agency reassignment without a break in service will not be considered a separation.
"An employee who doesn’t fulfill the 12-week work obligation after using PPL will be required to reimburse the IRS for the cost of the government's contribution toward the employee's federal health insurance, during the period of PPL use."
"See IRM 6.630.5.3.9, Recovery of IRS Costs for Health Insurance."
"6.630.5.3.9 (08-26-2025)
Recovery of IRS Costs for Health Insurance
If an employee fails to complete the 12-week work obligation, the IRS may recoup the total amount of contributions paid by the IRS for the employee to maintain the employee's health insurance coverage during the period of PPL."
The employee will owe a debt to the IRS for failing to complete the work obligation.
There is no authority for a partial waiver of the amount owed.
"The IRS will grant a waiver of, and not seek reimbursement for, the contributions paid by the IRS to maintain the employee’s health insurance coverage during the period of PPL in circumstances where an employee is unable to complete the 12-week work obligation due to:
The continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition (including mental health) of the employee only if the condition is related to the applicable birth or placement;
The serious health condition of the child whose birth or placement was the basis for the PPL; or
Any other circumstances beyond the employee’s control."
An employee’s request for a waiver due to circumstances beyond the employee’s control must be based upon circumstances that truly preclude the employee from returning to work.
"Example: An employee chooses to stay home because the child, whose birth or placement was the basis for the PPL, has a serious health condition or an employee moves because the employee's spouse is unexpectedly transferred to a job location more than 75 miles from the employee's POD."
Matters of employee preference or convenience for failing to complete the work obligation will not constitute circumstances beyond the employee’s control.
"For example, an employee who chooses not to return to work in order to stay home with a well, newborn child would not constitute a circumstance beyond the employee's control."
"If the employee says they cannot return to work because of a serious health condition or circumstances beyond the employee’s control, the IRS may require the employee to provide medical certification from the health care provider of the employee or child, as appropriate, or other appropriate documentation to support the waiver request."
The employee must provide such supporting certification within 30 calendar days of the date it is requested.
"For employees who fail to complete the 12-week work obligation and are not eligible for the mandatory waiver of the reimbursement, managers must promptly notify the Ogden Payroll Center to initiate collection of the IRS’s portion of the employee’s health insurance contributions, by submitting a ticket under category Employee Resources, Insurance, Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB)."
Employees normally receive written notice of the debt 30 days prior to when collection actions will begin.
"6.630.5.3.10 (08-26-2025)
Cases of Employee Incapacitation
If it is determined that an otherwise eligible employee, who could have elected to substitute PPL for unpaid FMLA leave and enter into a work obligation agreement was physically or mentally incapable of doing so during the period prior to use, the employee may, within five workdays of their return to duty status, make an election to retroactively substitute PPL for unpaid FMLA leave."
The retroactive PPL is effective on the date an election would have been effective if the employee had not been incapacitated at the time.
"The IRS must, upon the request of a personal representative of the employee with whom the IRS finds acceptable, provide conditional approval of substitution of PPL for applicable unpaid FMLA leave on a prospective basis."
The conditional approval is based on the presumption that the employee would have elected to substitute PPL for unpaid FMLA leave and would have entered into the work obligation agreement if the employee had not been incapacitated.
"Within five workdays after returning to work, the employee must complete Form 9611-B, Agreement to Complete 12-week Work Obligation, agreeing to complete the work obligation described in IRM 6.630.5.3.8, Work Obligation, or pay the required reimbursement (if applicable) unless the IRS determines the employee experiences:
The continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition (including mental health) of the employee only if the condition is related to the applicable birth, adoption or foster care placement of a child;
The serious health condition of the child whose birth or placement was the basis for the PPL; or
Any other circumstances beyond the employee’s control."
"If the IRS determines the employee is no longer incapacitated, and the employee declines to enter into the written work obligation, the IRS must cancel any portion of the 12 administrative workweeks (480 hours) of PPL that has not been used and invalidate any PPL that was used based on the conditional approval."
"The invalidated PPL must be converted to LWOP unless the employee requests other paid leave or paid time off to the employee’s credit, be applied, as appropriate, in place of the invalidated PPL."
"Pay received for any invalidated PPL hours not replaced by other paid leave or paid time off, is considered a debt to the IRS and is subject to collection."
"6.630.5.3.11 (08-26-2025)
Employee Transfer
If an employee transfers from the IRS to a different agency, or from a different agency to the IRS, while using PPL in connection with a birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child, the 12-week work obligation will be owed to the agency employing the employee at the time the use of PPL concludes."
The agency employing the employee at the time the use of PPL concludes will be responsible for documenting whether the employee fulfills the 12-week work obligation.
"When an employee transfers from the IRS to another employing agency and fails to fulfill the 12-week work obligation with that agency, the new agency will inform the IRS of the employee's failure."
"At that time, the IRS will make its own determination whether to recover the health insurance coverage paid by the IRS during the employee’s use of PPL."
"6.630.5.3.12 (08-26-2025)
Multiple Birth, Adoption, or Foster Care Placement Events
When multiple children are born (two or more) or placed for adoption or foster care on the same day, the multiple-childbirth/placement event is considered to be a single event that initiates a single entitlement of up to 12 administrative workweeks (480 hours) of PPL for a full-time employee."
"An employee who experiences another, separate placement or birth that does not occur on the same day during a 12-month period, is entitled to a new 12-month period."
The eligibility for PPL starts with the date of the second birth or placement.
The maximum PPL an employee can take during a 12-month period remains 480 hours (or appropriate prorated amount for part- time employees).
Any PPL taken during overlapping 12-month periods will count toward both entitlements.
"Example: If an employee gives birth to a child on June 1, 2021, and has another child placed for adoption on October 1, 2021, each event will generate entitlement to substitute up to 12 administrative workweeks (480 hours) of PPL during the separate 12-month periods beginning on the date of the birth and on the date of the placement, respectively."
"The two 12-month periods would be June 1, 2021, to May 31, 2022, for the birth, and October 1, 2021, to September 30, 2022, for the adoption."
"The overlap period for these two 12-month periods is October 1, 2021, to May 31, 2022."
"If the employee substitutes PPL for FMLA leave during that overlap period, that amount of PPL would count towards both the 12-week limit associated with the birth event and the 12-week limit associated with the placement event."
"6.630.5.4 (08-26-2025)
Additional Leave Options for Birth and Care of a Child
In addition to any leave the employee may be entitled to under the FMLA and/or the Paid Parental Leave Act, an employee may be granted an additional six months of unpaid leave unless the employee provides substituted paid leave for parental reasons."
"The IRS will not ordinarily require an employee to return to duty earlier than nine months after childbirth, subject to workload requirements."
An employee is not required to invoke entitlement to FMLA to request up to nine months of parental leave.
"However, the employee must invoke entitlement to FMLA to receive leave under the FMLA, including the substitution of PPL."
"An employee may use a combination of annual leave, sick leave, advanced leave, LWOP, previously earned credit hours, previously earned compensatory time off, or time off award hours during any PP."
"An employee is responsible for notifying the supervisor of their intent to request leave for parental reasons, (birth, adoption, or foster care placement of the employee’s child), including the type of leave, approximate dates, and anticipated duration."
"In addition to any entitlement to which a parent may have under FMLA or sick leave, and subject to workload, an employee may be absent on approved part-time or full-time annual leave or approved LWOP for a reasonable period of time for the purpose of assisting or caring for their minor children or the birthing parent while they are incapacitated due to childbirth."
"6.630.5.4.1 (08-26-2025)
Sick Leave
An employee is entitled to request and use sick leave while pregnant for personal medical appointments, any periods of incapacitation due to pregnancy (to include morning sickness and/or medically prescribed bed rest), childbirth, hospitalization, and recovery from childbirth."
Most doctors certify that the recovery period is about six to eight weeks.
"Note: There is no limit on the amount of sick leave an employee may use for their own personal medical needs; however, an employee has no entitlement to sick leave except for authorized sick leave purposes."
"See IRM 6.630.1.5, Sick Leave, for more information."
"A full-time employee may use up to 480 hours (12 weeks) of sick leave to care for an eligible employee’s family member with a serious health condition, such as a pregnant family member."
"For a part-time employee, the amount of sick leave that may be used to care for a family member with a serious health condition is prorated in proportion to the average number of hours of work in the employee's scheduled TOD each week."
"See IRM 6.630.1.9, Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), for more information."
An employee is not entitled to use sick leave to be absent from work to bond with or care for a healthy child.
"However, they may use up to 104 hours (13 days) of sick leave for general family care to care for a child with a minor illness, or to accompany a child to medical, dental, optical appointments, or well-baby doctor visits."
"An employee may use sick leave for general family care to:
Provide care for a family member who is incapacitated as a result of physical or mental illness, injury, pregnancy, or childbirth."
"Accompany a pregnant family member to attend medical appointments (see IRM 6.630.1.5.5, Sick Leave for Family Care, for the definitions of family member)
See IRM 6.630.1.5.5, Sick Leave for Family Care, for additional uses of sick leave for general family care."
"A full-time employee may request up to 480 hours (12 weeks) of sick leave each year to care for a family member, such as a child with a serious health condition."
"For a part-time employee, the amount of sick leave that may be used to care for a family member with a serious health condition is prorated in proportion to the average number of hours of work in the employee's scheduled TOD each week."
"See IRM 6.630.1.5.5, Sick Leave for Family Care, for more information."
"If any sick leave hours are used for general family care, they must be subtracted from 480 hours of sick leave available for care of a family member with a serious health condition."
"See IRM 6.630.1.5.5, Sick Leave for Family Care, for more information."
"6.630.5.4.2 (08-26-2025)
Annual Leave
An employee may request annual leave for their own pregnancy, care of a pregnant family member, childbirth and recovery from childbirth, to be absent from work to bond with or care for a newborn, and for other childcare responsibilities, to include taking the child to medical, dental, optical appointments, or well-baby doctor visits."
The use of annual leave is subject to managerial approval.
"See IRM 6.630.1.3, Annual Leave, for more information."
"6.630.5.4.3 (08-26-2025)
Advanced Leave

"6.630.5.4.4 (08-26-2025)
Donated Leave Under the Voluntary Leave Transfer and Leave Bank Programs
If an employee exhausts their sick and/or annual leave, they may receive donated annual leave under the Voluntary Leave Transfer and/or Leave Bank Programs."
These programs are for employees experiencing a personal or family medical emergency and who have exhausted their own available paid leave.
Donated annual leave may be used only for a medical emergency.
"For example, the donated leave may be used for the birthing parent’s period of incapacitation or the illness of a child and may not be used to bond with or care for a healthy child."
More information on the Leave Sharing Program is available on the IRS Source.
"6.630.5.4.5 (08-26-2025)
Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) Leave
An eligible employee, who meets qualifying criteria, is entitled to use a total of up to 480 hours (12 weeks) of LWOP under the FMLA for their own pregnancy, care of a pregnant family member (as defined in IRM 6.630.1.9.3, FMLA – Definitions), childbirth and recovery from childbirth (most doctors certify that the recovery period is about six to eight weeks), and care of the newborn."
An employee’s entitlement to FMLA leave begins on the date an employee first takes FMLA leave and continues for 12 months.
"If an employee takes FMLA leave prior to or on the actual date of birth, the 12-month period begins on that date."
The employee is not entitled to an additional 480 hours (12 weeks) of FMLA-LWOP until the previous 12- month period ends.
"The FMLA leave may be taken intermittently or under a work schedule reduced by the number of hours of FMLA leave, when medically necessary."
"See IRM 6.630.1.9, Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), for more information."
"An employee may elect to substitute paid leave, such as PPL, annual leave and/or sick leave, advanced annual and/or advanced sick leave, and leave made available through the voluntary Leave Sharing Programs, for any or all of the LWOP used under the FMLA, consistent with the laws and regulations governing these types of leave."
"An employee’s use of FMLA, including paid leave in substitution for unpaid FMLA, may reduce the amount of PPL available for birth or placement purposes as outlined in IRM 6.630.5.3.2, Interactions Between PPL and FMLA."
"See IRM 6.630.1.9, Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), for more information."
"The FMLA-LWOP may affect various employee entitlements, including the accrual of annual and/or sick leave."
"See IRM 6.630.1.2, Eligibility for Annual and Sick Leave, and OPM’s fact sheet, Effect of Extended Leave Without Pay (LWOP) (or Other Nonpay Status)."
"See IRM 6.630.1.9, Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), for more information."
"6.630.5.4.6 (08-26-2025)
Leave Without Pay (LWOP)
In addition to other leave entitlements, and subject to managerial approval, an employee may request and use LWOP for their own pregnancy, care of a pregnant family member, childbirth and recovery from childbirth, or to be absent from work to bond with or care for a newborn, in accordance with current business unit policy, and the negotiated agreement for BU employees."
"Please see IRM 6.630.1.10, Leave Without Pay (LWOP), for more information on LWOP."
"The LWOP may affect various employee entitlements, including the accrual of annual and/or sick leave."
"See IRM 6.630.1.2, Eligibility for Annual and Sick Leave, and the OPM’s fact sheet, Effect of Extended Leave Without Pay (LWOP) (or Other Nonpay Status), for more information."
This category of LWOP should not be confused with FMLA-LWOP.
"See IRM 6.630.1.9, Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) Leave, for information on FMLA-LWOP."
"6.630.5.5 (08-26-2025)
Additional Leave Options for Adoption and/or Foster Care
This section discusses leave options for adoption and/or foster care."
"6.630.5.5.1 (08-26-2025)
Sick Leave
An employee is entitled to request and use sick leave for absences from duty for purposes relating to the adoption of a child, including appointments with adoption agencies, social workers and attorneys, court proceedings, required travel, any periods of time during which the employee is ordered or required by the adoption agency or by the court to take time off from work to care for the adopted child, and any other activities necessary to allow the adoption to proceed."
An employee may be asked to provide administratively acceptable evidence for the use of sick leave for absences related to adoption proceedings.
There is no limitation on the amount of sick leave that may be used for adoption-related purposes as described in (1) above.
Sick leave for adoption-related purposes does not count towards the 104-hour (13 days) limit of sick leave each leave year for family care and bereavement purposes or the overall limit of 12 weeks of sick leave each leave year for all family care purposes.
An employee who is accompanying a family member to activities related to the placement of a child for adoption is not entitled to use sick leave for adoption.
An employee is not entitled to use sick leave for fostering a child unless the employee is adopting the foster child.
An employee is not entitled to use sick leave to be absent from work to bond with or care for a healthy child unless ordered or required by the adoption agency or court.
"However, an employee may use up to 104 hours (13 days) of sick leave for general family care to care for a child with a minor illness or to accompany a child to medical, dental, optical appointments, or well-child doctor visits (if applicable)."
"For a part-time employee, the amount of accrued sick leave for general family care that may be used for all family care purposes is prorated in proportion to the average number of hours of work in the employee's scheduled TOD each week."
"See IRM 6.630.1.5.5, Sick Leave for Family Care, for more information."
A full-time employee may request up to 480 hours (12 weeks) of sick leave each year to care for a child with a serious health condition.
"For a part-time employee, the amount of sick leave that may be used to care for a family member with a serious health condition is prorated in proportion to the average number of hours of work in the employee's scheduled TOD each week."
The amount of accrued sick leave an employee may use for all family care purposes may not exceed 480 hours (12 weeks) in a leave year.
"If any sick leave hours are used for general family care, they must be subtracted from the 480 hours of sick leave available for care of a family member with a serious health condition."
"See IRM 6.630.1.5.5, Sick Leave for Family Care, for more information."
"6.630.5.5.2 (08-26-2025)

"In addition, an employee may use annual leave to be absent from work to bond with or care for a healthy child, and/or for other childcare responsibilities including taking the child to medical, dental, optical appointments, well-child visits (if applicable), or any other purpose."
The use of annual leave is subject to managerial approval.
"See IRM 6.630.1.3, Annual Leave, for more information."
"6.630.5.5.3 (08-26-2025)
Advanced Leave
Pursuant to business requirements, an employee may be advanced up to 30 days (240 hours) of sick leave, to include purposes relating to adoption."
"For a part-time employee, the amount of advanced sick leave that may be used for adoption purposes is prorated in proportion to the average number of hours of work in the employee's scheduled TOD each week."
An employee may be advanced the amount of annual leave hours that would accrue during the remainder of the current leave year for purposes of adoption and foster care regardless of their length of service.
"An employee is required to repay all advanced sick leave, except in very limited circumstances such as disability or death."
"For information regarding the use and repayment of advanced sick leave, see IRM 6.630.1.6, Advanced Leave."
"See IRM 6.630.5.6, Advanced Leave for Childbirth, Adoption and Foster Care, for information on eligibility, approval requirements, procedures for applying, etc."
"6.630.5.5.4 (08-26-2025)
Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) Leave
An eligible employee is entitled to use a total of up to 480 hours (12 weeks) of LWOP under the FMLA for the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care, or for care of their child with a serious health condition."
An employee who is accompanying a family member to activities related to the placement of a child for adoption is not entitled to unpaid leave under the FMLA.
An employee’s entitlement to FMLA-LWOP begins on the date of placement and expires 12 months from that date.
FMLA-LWOP may be taken intermittently or under a work schedule reduced by the number of hours of FMLA-LWOP unless mutually agreed upon between the manager and employee.
"See IRM 6.630.1.9, Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), for more information."
"An employee may elect to substitute paid leave to include PPL, accrued annual leave and/or sick leave, advanced annual and/or advanced sick leave and leave made available through the Leave Sharing Programs, for any or all FMLA-LWOP, consistent with the laws and regulations governing these types of leave."
"FMLA-LWOP may affect various employee entitlements, including the accrual of annual and/or sick leave."

"See IRM 6.630.1.10, Leave Without Pay (LWOP) for more information on LWOP."
"LWOP may affect various employee entitlements, including the accrual of annual and/or sick leave."
"See IRM 6.630.1.2, Eligibility for Annual and Sick Leave, and OPM’s fact sheet, Effect of Extended Leave Without Pay (LWOP) (or Other Nonpay Status), for more information."
"This category of LWOP should not be confused with FMLA-LWOP that is used for the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care as described in IRM 6.630.5.5.4, Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) Leave."
"6.630.5.6 (08-26-2025)
Advanced Leave for Childbirth, Adoption, and Foster Care
Barring unusual or extenuating circumstances, requests to use advanced annual and/or advanced sick leave must be approved to the extent permitted by law for purposes relating to childbirth, adoption, and foster care."
Advanced leave may be used in conjunction with other applicable leave programs such as the FMLA and leave acquired under the Voluntary Leave Sharing Program.
"The option for this type of leave begins on the date of first use and may occur prior to or on the actual date of birth of the child, or placement for adoption or foster care."
"An employee must submit requests to their immediate supervisor using existing business unit procedures no less than 30 calendar days before the leave is to begin, if the need for leave is foreseeable, or within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the circumstances if the leave is not foreseeable."
"An employee is required to repay all advanced sick leave, except in very limited circumstances such as disability or death."
"For information regarding the use and repayment of advanced sick leave, see IRM 6.630.1.6, Advanced Leave."
"6.630.5.6.1 (08-26-2025)
Advanced Sick Leave for Childbirth, Adoption, and Foster Care
An employee may request and be advanced up to 30 days (240 hours) of sick leave for childbirth and adoption."
"For a part-time employee, the amount of advanced sick leave that may be used for childbirth and adoption is prorated in proportion to the average number of hours of work in the employee's scheduled TOD each week."
An employee’s request to use advanced sick leave for childbirth and adoption must be granted as long as the request meets eligibility requirements and the employee’s negative sick leave balance does not exceed 240.
"For additional information such as the use, eligibility and repayment of advanced sick leave, see IRM 6.630.1.6.2, Advanced Sick Leave."
"An employee may request and be approved to use advanced sick leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition, such as the employee’s child."

Additional Flexibilities for Family Purposes
The IRS offers various leave and work scheduling flexibilities to assist an employee in meeting work and personal obligations."
"For more information on these flexibilities, refer to the IRS Source and search on the subject of interest."
"Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules:
If work requirements and business unit needs permit, an employee may request a flexible or compressed work schedule to help balance work and personal responsibilities."
"For more information, see IRM 6.610.1.5.2, Alternative Work Schedules, and for BU employees, see also Article 23 of the National Agreement available at: Document 11678, National Agreement."
"The IRS Telework Program:
Telework enhances work-life balance and supports continuity of operations."
"For more information, see IRM 6.800.2, IRS Telework Program, and for BU employees, Article 50 of the National Agreement available at: Document 11678, National Agreement."
"The IRS Lactation Program:
The IRS provides a supportive environment to enable nursing employees to express milk during business hours."
"See IRM 6.800.4, IRS Lactation Program for more information on workplace accommodations for employees who are nursing a baby."
"The IRS Reasonable Accommodation Program:
In accordance with the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (29 USC Part 1636), a reasonable accommodation may be requested and must be approved for a qualified employee in relation to, affected by, or arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or related physical or mental medical conditions."
The request does not have to identify a medical condition or use medical terms.
"The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act includes a non-exhaustive list of examples for the definition of “pregnancy” and “childbirth” to include current pregnancy, past pregnancy, potential or intended pregnancy (which can include infertility, fertility treatments, and the use of contraception), and labor and childbirth (including vaginal delivery and cesarean section)."
"“Related medical conditions” are medical conditions that relate to pregnancy or childbirth, and need not be caused solely, originally, or substantially by pregnancy or childbirth, and can include but are not limited to, lactation (including breastfeeding and pumping), miscarriage, stillbirth, having or choosing not to have an abortion, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets) syndrome."
"For more information, see IRM 1.20.2, Providing Reasonable Accommodation for Individuals with Disabilities, and for BU employees, Article 55 of the National Agreement available at: Document 11678, National Agreement."
"6.630.5.8 (08-26-2025)
Parental Bereavement Leave
Parental bereavement leave is a separate paid leave entitlement for eligible employees and is distinct from sick leave earned in accordance with IRM 6.630.1.5.5, Sick Leave for Family Care which may also be used for bereavement purposes."
Parental bereavement leave does not affect the accrual or balances of other paid leave or paid time off.
"An employee may continue to use sick leave for bereavement purposes found in IRM 6.630.1.5.5, Sick Leave for Family Care."
"For example, an employee may request and be approved to use parental bereavement leave, sick leave for bereavement purposes, LWOP, annual leave or another type of paid or unpaid leave, as appropriate to cover an absence due to their child’s death."
Eligible employees are entitled to use a total of two administrative work weeks of paid parental bereavement leave within a 12-month period due to the death of the employee’s child.
The 12-month period used for this purpose begins on the date of the child’s death.
"6.630.5.8.1 (08-26-2025)
Eligibility
To be eligible for parental bereavement leave, the individual must:
Be on a permanent, seasonal, or term appointment."
"Employees on a temporary or intermittent position are not eligible; and
Have completed 12 consecutive or nonconsecutive months of federal service; and
The eligible employee’s absence must be due to the occurrence of the death of the employee’s child on or after December 27, 2021."
"“Child” means a biological, adopted or foster child, stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis who is:
Under 18 years of age; or
18 years of age or older and incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability; or."
"Unborn (e.g., miscarriage or stillbirth)."
"6.630.5.8.2 (08-26-2025)
Limitations
Full-time employees with an 80-hour biweekly schedule, may use up to 80 hours of paid parental bereavement leave within a 12-month period."
Part-time employees and employees on an uncommon TOD may use up to the total number of regularly scheduled work hours in their biweekly TOD within a 12-month period.
Example: A part-time employee working 24 hours per week (48 hours in their biweekly TOD) may use up to 48 hours of parental bereavement leave within a 12-month period.
An employee may not receive more than two administrative workweeks of parental bereavement leave within a 12-month period.
Parental bereavement leave may not be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule unless mutually agreed upon between the manager and employee.
"If bereavement leave is subject to the continuous use requirement, a holiday or other nonwork day is not considered to be an interruption in continuous use even though bereavement leave is not charged for those hours."
"If an employee does not use all available parental bereavement leave for a given 12-month period, the employee will not be able to use the remaining balance unless the employee experiences the death of another child within the 12-month period."
Parental bereavement leave may not be used on a holiday or any other nonwork day.
"For example, a seasonal employee may not use parental bereavement leave during off-season periods when the employee is placed in a nonduty/nonpay status."
"An employee who is on leave, such as PPL to cover absences related to the care of a newborn or new placement of a child, may request and be approved to use parental bereavement leave to cover an absence if that child should pass away."
"If there is a change in the employee’s scheduled TOD before they use the full two workweeks of parental bereavement entitlement, the remaining balance of parental bereavement leave must be recalculated based on the change in their TOD hours."
"Example: If a full-time employee has a balance of 40 hours of unused parental bereavement leave, then converts to a part-time schedule of 24 hours per week, the new recalculated parental bereavement leave balance would be 24 hours."
"To explain, the old full-time schedule was 80 hours per biweekly TOD, and the new part-time schedule is 48 hours per biweekly TOD."
The new part-time schedule is 60% of the former full-time schedule or (48 hours / 80 hours = 60%).
"Therefore, the employee has already used 60% of their entitlement."
Multiply 60% by the unused balance of 40 hours to arrive at 24 hours of converted parental bereavement leave (48 hours / 80 hours) = 60% x 40 hours = 24 hours).
"If an employee is found by proper authority to have deliberately caused the child’s death, the employee is not entitled to parental bereavement leave."
Any parental bereavement leave that was used prior must be retroactively canceled.
"6.630.5.8.3 (08-26-2025)
Multiple Deaths
In the unfortunate event more than one qualifying child of the employee dies during a 12-month period that does not occur on the same day, a new 12-month period will begin on the date of the most recent child’s death."
An employee may have overlapping 12-month periods.
Any parental bereavement leave used during the overlapping periods will count against the two-week limit for each affected 12-month period.
"6.630.5.8.4 (08-26-2025)
Documentation and Requirements
Employees must request and secure approval of their intent to use parental bereavement leave in accordance with their business unit’s procedures within a reasonable and practicable advance notice."
An employee is entitled to use parental bereavement leave upon request if the employee meets eligibility requirements.
"The IRS may request the employee to provide a written self-certification or other documentation, such as a death certificate, to certify the leave request."
"6.630.5.8.5 (08-26-2025)
Transfer or Separation
If an employee transfers to the IRS from another agency, a determination must be made whether the newly hired or transferred employee is within a 12-month period based on the date of death of the employee’s child and the number of parental bereavement leave hours the employee has already used."
Any unused balance of parental bereavement leave transfers with the employee as long as the employee is within the 12-month eligibility period for parental bereavement leave.
Any agreement between the employee and the previous employing agency regarding intermittent use of parental bereavement leave is not binding on the receiving agency.
"If an employee separates from the IRS with an unused balance of parental bereavement leave, any right to the unused leave is terminated."
"6.630.5.8.6 (08-26-2025)
Retroactive Use
If it is determined that an employee used LWOP to cover an absence due to the death of their child occurring on or after December 27, 2021, the employee may request to retroactively substitute the unpaid leave for parental bereavement leave, and the request must be granted retroactively."
"If an employee used other paid leave to cover an absence for which parental bereavement leave could have been used, an employee’s request to retroactively substitute parental bereavement leave may be granted if it is determined the employee lacked information on parental bereavement leave or was not allowed to use parental bereavement leave at the time."
"Parental bereavement leave cannot be retroactively used prior to December 27, 2021."

"6.711.1.2 (08-27-2025)
Labor Relations Authorities
The Federal Labor Relations Authority (Authority or FLRA), also known as the Federal Service Labor Management Relations statute, is codified in 5 USC 71."
The FLRA is an independent administrative federal agency that administers the LMR program for non-postal federal employees.
"The FLRA is composed of the Authority, the Office of General Counsel, and the Federal Services Impasses Panel."
The Authority has three full-time members appointed by the President of the United States.
"They adjudicate ULP disputes, applications for review of decisions and orders issued in representation matters, exceptions to grievance arbitration awards, and negotiability disputes that arise during collective bargaining."
The Authority also provides statutory training to assist federal agencies and unions in understanding their rights and responsibilities under 5 USC 71.
"The Office of General Counsel promotes effective LMR by investigating Unfair Labor Practice allegations and prosecuting them when warranted, conducting elections and determining representational matters, issuing guidance, providing training to federal managers and unions, and providing alternative dispute resolution services."
The Federal Service Impasses Panel (FSIP or Panel) resolves impasses between federal agencies and unions representing federal employees arising under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (5 USC 71) and the Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act (5 USC 61).
"If bargaining followed by mediation assistance does not result in a voluntary agreement, either party (management or NTEU) or the parties jointly may request the Panel's assistance."
"If the Panel has jurisdiction, it has the authority to recommend and/or direct the use of various dispute-resolution procedures."
"If the parties are unable to reach a voluntary settlement after using the dispute-resolution procedures, the Panel may take whatever action it deems necessary, including the imposition of contract terms, to resolve the dispute."
The parties may not appeal the merits of the Panel's decision to any court.
.
"6.711.1.3 (08-27-2025)
Exclusive Union Representation
NTEU may represent or act on behalf of BU employees in:
Negotiations with management regarding COE
Formal discussions conducted by management concerning grievances, personnel policies or practices, or other conditions of employment, and
Conduct investigations if the employee reasonably believes the interview may result in discipline and the employee requests NTEU representation."
"6.711.1.4 (08-27-2025)
Managing Changes to BU Conditions of Employment
Managers are responsible for communicating and consulting with their colleagues about potential changes in BU COE."
Sharing potential changes with other members of management is fundamental to effective communications.
Prompt and effective communications results in managers learning about potential BU COE changes through management channels rather than from NTEU or other sources.
"Before a change to BU COE can be negotiated, if required, or implemented, management must read IRM 1.11.2.5.1.4, IRM Changes Affecting Conditions of Employment of Bargaining Unit Employees, and IRM 1.11.9.4.4, Labor/Employee Relations & Negotiations, and follow the procedures to contact LERN."
"When analyzing a potential change to BU COE consider, for example:
The impact on BU employees
CBA requirements (e.g., the NA)
Management’s rights in the labor-management relationship
Management’s interests and responsibilities, and
The legal responsibility to NTEU."
"Note: See Article 47, Mid-Term Bargaining, of the 2022 National Agreement, for procedures and time limits for notice and bargaining."
"All bargaining between the parties is national in scope except for Reassignments/Realignments and Voluntary Relocations (see Article 15, Reassignments/Realignments and Voluntary Relocations, of the 2022 National Agreement)."
"LRSN provides notice to NTEU prior to implementing any change that has more than a de minimis impact (i.e., the BU COE matter is substantively negotiable) on personnel policies, practices, or other matters affecting the working conditions of BU employees."
NTEU and management must negotiate in good faith to reach agreement.
"If an agreement is reached, a written agreement is prepared."
"If no agreement is reached and the parties are at impasse, management may not implement the change for BU employees until third-party options are attempted (e.g., requesting FMCS assistance and filing a request with FSIP)."
"If management implements a BU COE change before third-party options are resolved, NTEU may file a ULP."
HCO and the impacted business unit(s) senior leadership will determine whether to implement the change for only NBU employees while negotiations are conducted for BU employees.
"Note: In rare circumstances, if an extraordinary and exigent need to implement a change to BU COE arises prior to completing negotiations, management must discuss this situation with LRSN before implementing the change."
"6.711.1.5 (08-27-2025)
ULP Charges and Complaints
See 5 USC 7116 for a list of the actions considered to be a ULP."
"ULPs may be filed with the FLRA by any individual, NTEU or the IRS."

"Remedies include orders to the charged party to cease and desist from the ULP, which usually requires the charged party to post a notice promising not to violate the law."
"The Authority can also order more stringent remedies, such as rescinding the action at issue."
"6.711.1.5.1 (08-27-2025)
ULP Reporting

"6.711.1.5.3 (08-27-2025)
FLRA Investigation of a ULP Charge
The FLRA investigator will work with the assigned GLS attorney to schedule interviews with managers and/or employees, as appropriate."
"If the FLRA invites an employee(s) to participate in a proceeding (e.g., giving a statement to the FLRA investigator), the employee should be granted administrative time to attend."

"LRSN must approve the proposed settlement agreement if it affects the national labor management practices, policies, and procedures."
"LRSN may need to secure Agency Head Review approval
The proposed settlement must not be discussed with parties, who don’t have a need to know, such as a local union official or employee."

"NTEU must articulate a particularized need for the requested information (i.e., why they need the information, how they plan to use it, and how use of the information relates to their representational responsibilities under the statute)."
A generic statement that the information is needed to perform NTEU’s representational responsibilities does not establish a particularized need.
"6.711.1.8.2 (08-27-2025)
Responding to Information Requests
See Article 8, Union Rights, of the 2022 National Agreement, for time limits to provide information or seek clarification."

"6.711.1.9 (08-27-2025)
Material Relied On Requests
Requests for material relied on (MRO) are not information requests under 5 USC 7114(b)(4)."
"MROs may be requested as described in the employee’s advance notice (i.e., a proposal letter for a conduct or performance issue)."
"See IRM 6.752.1.21, Advance Notice, or IRM 6.432.1.10, Advance Notice (Proposal Letter) Based on Unacceptable Performance."

"6.711.1.10 (08-27-2025)
Union Dues
See Article 10, Dues Withholding, of the 2022 National Agreement, for details."
"Separate authority may exist apart from 5 USC 7115 to honor membership dues assignments from individuals who are not included within a bargaining unit although such authority would not apply in the case of assignments payable to labor organizations, such as NTEU which represent bargaining unit employees."
"Certain supervisors, for example, may qualify for dues assignments under a savings provision found at 5 CFR 550.322."
"In cases such as these, any agreements between the IRS and NTEU are inapplicable, and the assignment will be handled in accordance with any other requirements that may apply."
"6.711.1.11 (08-27-2025)

(39) Prior Offense - A previously imposed penalty which is still a matter of record.
"An employee’s past discipline record may be reviewed when considering Douglas Factor 3, Disciplinary Record."

Appellant was informed of the action in writing

The action is a matter of record, and

Appellant was given the opportunity to dispute the charge(s) to a higher level than the authority who imposed the discipline."
"(40) Progressive Discipline - The penalty for misconduct is tailored to the facts and circumstances; however, escalating penalties may be imposed for repeat misconduct."

(44) Removal - An involuntary separation based on the decision of a delegated authority which terminates the employer-employee relationship.
"(45) Reprimand - A disciplinary action used when an action to address misconduct warrants an action more severe than an admonishment, but less severe than a suspension or an action involving a loss of grade/pay."
Letters of reprimand are filed in an employee’s OPF.
(46) Standard Form 50 (SF-50) - A Notification of Personnel Action that contains certain employment information.
It is a permanent document that is filed in an employee’s OPF.
"See Document 12787, SF-50: Notification of Personnel Action – An Overview."
"(47) Substantial Evidence - The degree of relevant evidence that a reasonable person, considering the record as a whole, might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even though other reasonable persons might disagree."
This is a lower standard of proof than preponderance of the evidence and is the standard of proof the IRS must meet when taking a suspension of 14 days or less.
(48) Suspension - The placement of an employee in a temporary status without duties or pay for misconduct.
Suspensions served solely on non-duty days do not meet the definition of suspension.
"Note: In compliance with 5 CFR 752.601, Coverage, Senior Executive Service (SES) employees may not be suspended for 14 days or less."

Delegation of Authority
(1) See IRM 1.2.2, Servicewide Delegations of Authority, for Delegation Order 6-29, Authority to Address Employee Performance or Conduct Issues."
"Note: If the subject of a corrective action is on a:
1."
Temporary assignment recorded on an SF-50 - The delegated authority(s) is the management chain for the employee’s temporary assignment.
2.
Detail/assignment that is not recorded on an SF-50 - The delegated authority(s) is the management chain for the employee’s permanent position of record.
"Note: CI employees see IRM 1.2.2.7.18.1, Criminal Investigation Deviation from Servicewide Delegation Order 6-29, Authority to Address Employee Performance or Conduct Issues."
"6.752.1.9 (12-13-2024)
Concept of Discipline
(1) Employees are expected to follow the ethics rules from the Office of Government Ethics, the Department of the Treasury, and the IRS (see Document 12011, IRS Ethics Handbook, and IRM 6.735, Ethics Matters)."
"The absence of a specific rule covering an act that discredits an employee or the IRS, does not mean that such an act is condoned or allowed."
Employees are also expected to follow work procedures to accomplish the IRS mission.
Failure to follow the ethics rules or performance procedures may result in a corrective action.
(2) Management’s right to discipline employees is covered in 5 USC 7106(a)(2)(A).
(3) Management issues a corrective action when called for by the employee’s misconduct.
"(4) The IRS does not use a standard schedule of offenses and penalties; however, the Penalty Guide (Document 11500) is available to assist management in determining appropriate penalties."
The guide does not cover all offenses.
"If an offense is not listed, it does not mean a penalty cannot be imposed."
"Except for mandatory penalties required by law, such as misuse of a government vehicle or violations of RRA ’98, the penalties suggested are guidelines, not a rigid standard."
"Deviations from the guide are allowed and greater or lesser penalties may be imposed, based on the facts of the case."
"Note: Certain offenses carry penalties mandated by law, rule, regulation, or IRS policy."
"For example, RRA ’98 violations require removal; misuse of a government vehicle violations require a 30-day suspension (see 31 USC 1349, Adverse personnel actions); the willful unauthorized access, attempted access or inspection of taxpayer records violations require removal (see IRM 10.5.5, IRS Unauthorized Access, Attempted Access or Inspection of Taxpayer Records (UNAX) Program Policy, Guidance, and Requirements)."
"(5) When contemplating a corrective action, management considers each case individually based on its own merits and supporting evidence."
"6.752.1.10 (12-13-2024)
Prohibition Against Discrimination
(1) Under no circumstances shall discipline be based on race, color, sex (including sexual orientation, gender identity, and pregnancy), parental status, religion, national origin, age (40 or older), disability (mental or physical), genetic information, marital status, political affiliation, or reprisal for protected activity."
The IRS also prohibits retaliation for engaging in the EEO process.
"6.752.1.11 (12-13-2024)
Management Investigation
(1) Incidents of misconduct come to management’s attention in a variety of ways."
"Management may:

Observe misconduct

Receive information from another employee or supervisor

Have physical evidence an employee engaged in misconduct, or

Receive information from TIGTA or LERN."
(2) Managers must address misconduct immediately and contact LERN for guidance.
Contacting LERN ensures managers follow policy and procedures.
"It also ensures compliance with IRM 6.332.2.4, Prior Performance & Misconduct Check/Screening."
"(3) Before scheduling an interview with a BU employee to discuss a misconduct matter, managers must consult with LERN to understand their responsibilities under Article 5, Section 4, of the National Agreement."
"See 5 USC 7114(a)(2)(B), sometimes referred to as Weingarten Rights, per NLRB v. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U.S. 251 (1975)."
"(4) During interviews with employees to discuss misconduct, if the employee refuses to respond to questions, management will advise them per 31 CFR 0.210."
"As directed, employees must respond to questions truthfully and under oath when required, whether orally or in writing, and must provide documents and other materials concerning matters of official interest when directed to do so by competent Treasury authority (for example, TIGTA or an IRS manager)."
"Failure to respond or provide documents, as directed, may result in corrective action."
"6.752.1.12 (12-13-2024)
TIGTA Investigation
(1) TIGTA initiates conduct investigations based on complaints or allegations about employees originating from management, taxpayers, taxpayer representatives, or allegations made by IRS employees."
"(2) Any allegation or information that an employee may have committed a crime must be promptly reported to TIGTA (see IRM 6.735.1.3, Reporting Ethics Violations)."

"(3) An appellant has the burden to prove the IRS committed a harmful error in their suspension of more than 14 days, removal, reduction in grade/band or pay, or furlough for 30 days or less."
"6.752.1.14 (12-13-2024)
Alternative Discipline (AD)
(1) AD is a non-traditional approach to correct misconduct."
"(2) AD objectives:

Modify unacceptable behavior

Prevent future conduct issues, and

Achieve results with less time and resources."
"(3) Per Article 38, Section 2, of the National Agreement, management must offer AD to BU employees if they determine a letter of reprimand or suspension of 1 to 14 days will be imposed/proposed."
"If management believes AD is a feasible option to correct the employee’s conduct issue, discussions must occur prior to entering into an agreement or issuing a reprimand or proposal to suspend for less than 14 days."
"Management, the employee, and NTEU must agree on the AD."
"Note:
a) Management has the option of offering AD to NBU employees if they believe AD is a feasible option to correct the employee’s conduct issue."
"b) For SES employees, AD is only available when a letter of reprimand is recommended."
c) CI does not allow AD.

The IRS will not impose any restraint, interference, coercion, or discrimination against any employee who exercises their right to designate NTEU to represent them in matters concerning the interpretation or application of the National Agreement."
"A BU employee who is the subject of a conduct investigation or is being interviewed as a third-party witness, and who reasonably believes that an interview by a representative of the Employer, such as management or TIGTA, may result in discipline has the right to request representation by a person designated by NTEU."
"(2) For suspensions and above, all employees may choose to be represented by an attorney or other representative."
"See 5 CFR 752.203, 5 CFR 752.404 and 5 CFR 752.604."
"Per the National Agreement, BU employees may be represented by NTEU."
"(3) For letters of admonishment or reprimand, employees have the right to file a grievance in compliance with Article 41 of the Addendum to the National Agreement, for BU employees, or IRM 6.771.1, Agency Grievance System (AGS)."

(5) The employee’s written designation of a representative is provided to the manager named in the Advance Notice.
The manager provides a copy of the designation to their assigned LERN specialist.
"6.752.1.18 (12-13-2024)
Rights of Representatives
(1) Representatives may exercise their functions without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or coercion."
"(2) Per 5 USC 7114(a)(2)(A), BU employees may be represented by the union."

"), of the Addendum to the National Agreement."
"(3) Representatives are allowed a reasonable amount of time (bank, official, or administrative, as appropriate) to prepare for and present reply(ies) on behalf of the employee."
This includes time to review documents or interview other IRS employees on relevant matters.
"6.752.1.19 (12-13-2024)
Denial of Representative
(1) Per 5 CFR 752.203 and 5 CFR 752.404, the IRS will allow employees to be represented by an attorney or other representative unless such choice:

Creates a conflict of interest or position - This occurs when the representative’s IRS duties conflict with the functions of the representative."
"For example, if the requested representative participated in or has special knowledge about the matter by virtue of their assigned duties."
"Imposes unreasonable costs to the government - This can include any travel cost, or any expenses requested by the representative to fulfill their role."
Conflicts with the priority needs of the IRS - The IRS mission takes precedence.
The requested representative may be disallowed if their priority work assignment precludes their release from official duties.
"(2) Within five calendar days of receiving the employee’s written designation of representative, if management is disallowing the representative, they will provide the written disallowance to the employee and the disallowed representative."
"The written disallowance must include:

The reason(s) and specifics why the representative is being disallowed

The Proposing Official should consider reasonable requests for more time to designate another representative.
"6.752.1.20 (12-13-2024)
Douglas Factors
(1) In Douglas v. Veterans Administration, 5 MSPR 280 (1981), the MSPB identified 12 factors (Douglas Factors) management must consider when determining an adverse action under 5 CFR 752."
"Note: The National Agreement combines two factors, Consistency with Other Penalties and Consistency with a Table of Penalties, and therefore identifies 11 factors."
"Note: For BU employees, Article 38 of the National Agreement, requires consideration of the Douglas Factors for admonishments and reprimands."
This provision does not apply to NBU employees.
"(2) Management must consider the relevant Douglas Factors for adverse actions under 5 CFR 752 that do not require a mandatory penalty (for example, misuse of a government vehicle or a Section 1203 violation)."
Some factors may weigh in the employee’s favor (mitigating factors) and others may constitute aggravating factors.
Management’s determination of the appropriate penalty is decided on a case-by-case basis.
"Note: When charging in the alternative, management must consider relevant Douglas Factors."
Alternative charges are based on the same set of facts.
"For example, the proposal letter states, you are charged with either violating Section 1203(b)(8) of the Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 or violating 5 CFR 2635.809, Just Financial Obligations."
"In this example, the Douglas Factors must be considered for the 5 CFR 2635.809 violation."
"(3) If an action is appealed to a third party, the Deciding Official will be questioned about their consideration of the relevant Douglas Factors, and they must be able to explain the reason for their penalty choice."
A third party will decide whether management considered all relevant factors and if the penalty choice was within the bounds of reasonableness.
"(4) The 12 Douglas Factors are:

Nature and Seriousness - The nature and seriousness of the offense and its relation to the employee’s duties, position, and responsibilities, including whether the offense was intentional or technical and inadvertent, or was committed maliciously or for gain, or was frequently repeated."
"Employeeʼs Job - The employee’s job level and type of employment, including supervisory or fiduciary role, contacts with the public, and prominence of the position."
Past Disciplinary Record - The employeeʼs past discipline record (disciplinary/adverse actions).
"Past Work Record - The employee’s past work record, including length of service, performance on the job, ability to get along with fellow workers, and dependability."
Effect on Future Performance - The effect of the offense upon the employee’s ability to perform at a satisfactory level and its effect upon supervisors’ confidence in the employee’s work ability to perform assigned duties.
Consistency with Other Penalties - Consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses.
"Note: When management considers this factor, they usually ensure the penalty is consistent with similarly situated employees within their work unit who committed the same/similar offense."
"However, in compliance with the MSPB’s precedential opinion, Singh v. USPS, 2022 MSPB 15, 2022 WL 1772249 (May 31, 2022), special circumstances may justify expanding the scope of the comparison to within the subject’s business unit or Servicewide."
"For example, if multiple employees commit misconduct together and they each report to a different supervisor/work unit, the comparison can be expanded outside the supervisory chain/work unit."
Consistency with Table of Penalties - Consistency of the penalty with a Table of Penalties if the agency has such a table (they are not required).
The IRS Table of Penalties is the Penalty Guide (Document 11500).
Notoriety and Impact - The notoriety of the offense or its impact upon the reputation of the IRS.
Clarity of Notice - The clarity with which the employee was on notice of any rules that were violated in committing the offense or had been warned about the conduct in question.
Potential for Rehabilitation - The potential for the employee’s rehabilitation.
"Mitigating Circumstances - Mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense such as unusual job tensions, personality problems, mental impairment, harassment, or bad faith, malice, or provocation on the part of others involved in the matter."
Alternative Sanctions - The adequacy and effectiveness of alternative sanctions to deter such conduct in the future by the employee or others.
(5) Any Douglas Factor considered by management must be specifically identified in the Advance Notice and the decision letter.
A generic statement about management’s consideration of the relevant Douglas Factors must be included in admonishments or reprimands for BU employees.
(6) Contact the assigned LERN specialist for guidance about considering the Douglas Factors.
"6.752.1.21 (12-13-2024)
Advance Notice (Proposal Letter)
(1) Suspensions of 14 days or less - Per 5 CFR 752.203, management must provide an employee with written Advance Notice before effecting a suspension of 14 days or less."
"Under Article 38 of the National Agreement, the written notice specifying the reason(s) for the proposed action must be issued to BU employees 15 calendar days before effecting the action."
The 15-calendar day notice period also applies to NBU employees.
The Advance Notice is not grievable.
Note: The calculation of days begins the day after the notice is delivered.
"If the deadline falls on a non-workday, the deadline is extended to the next workday."
"(2) Suspensions of more than 14 days, removals, reductions in grade or pay, furlough of 30 days or less - Per 5 CFR 752.404, management must provide an employee with written Advance Notice, which specifies the reason(s) for the proposed action, 30 calendar days before effecting these types of adverse actions (see Article 39 of the National Agreement, for BU employees)."
The Advance Notice is not grievable.
Note: The calculation of days begins the day after the notice is delivered.
"If the deadline falls on a non-workday, the deadline is extended to the next workday."
"Note: If there is reasonable cause to believe the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, the Advance Notice period may be shortened, per 5 CFR 752.404."
"See IRM 6.752.1.22, Crime Provision (Exception to 30-day Advance Notice Period)."
(3) The Advance Notice of proposed action is drafted by a LERN specialist.
"It is reviewed, approved, and issued by the manager with the delegated authority (Proposing Official)."
"See IRM 6.752.1.8, Delegation of Authority."
"(4) Management must work with their assigned LERN specialist to ensure the contents of the Advance Notice follow law, rule, regulation, and for BU employees, the National Agreement."
Failure to include required information may result in the MSPB reversing the action taken.
"(5) An Advance Notice proposing a suspension, removal, reduction in grade/band or pay, or a furlough of 30 days or less will include, as applicable, the following information:

A statement that the proposal letter is issued per 5 CFR 752

A statement that the proposed action promotes the efficiency of the service

A statement that the action may be taken at any time after the Advance Notice period

The proposed action, including the number of calendar days for a proposed suspension

The reason(s) and specification(s) for the proposed action

"A nexus statement for off-duty misconduct, if applicable

Note: See IRM 6.752.1.24, Supplemental Notice, for requirements if management decides to change the nexus statement after issuing the proposal letter."
"A statement describing what management considered in proposing the action

A statement of the employee’s and/or representative’s right to request and review the material relied on (evidence) to support the reason(s) and specification(s)

Note: The LERN specialist is responsible for releasing the material relied on, if requested."
A statement about disclosing tax information if tax return information is used in the specification(s) or material relied on.

A statement about the employee’s right to appeal and appeal forums if the proposed action is upheld, and

A statement that a final decision will be issued after the reply periods passes, any replies are considered, and the Advanced Notice period expires."
"For BU employees only, include a statement that the NTEU chapter who represents the employee and the NTEU National Field Office will simultaneously receive a redacted copy of the Advance Notice (that is, personally identifiable information and information protected by the Internal Revenue Code is removed), per Articles 38 and 39 of the National Agreement."
"See IRM 6.752.1.28, Redacting Letters with Personally Identifiable Information."
"Note: If a taxpayer key is attached to the employee’s proposal letter, it is not provided with the simultaneous delivery."
"The information can be requested in compliance with IRM 6.752.1.29, Guidelines for Identifying and Releasing Tax Information for Use in a Personnel Matter."
"Note: If the conduct involves the employee’s personal tax matter, generalized tax information is provided with the simultaneous delivery in compliance with the 2009 IRS-NTEU Settlement Agreement regarding overly sanitized letters."
Contact the assigned LERN specialist for more information.
"See IRM 6.752.1.28, Redacting Letters with Personally Identifiable Information."
(6) Management delivers the Advance Notice to the employee in person when possible.
"If personal delivery is not possible/appropriate (for example, the manager would need to travel since the employee is not co-located with them), management delivers the Advance Notice by encrypted e-mail."
Management asks the employee to acknowledge receipt of the notice with their signature and date.
"If the employee refuses to acknowledge receipt, the manager delivering the notice attests to delivering the notice by signing and dating it and includes the following statement: Employee refused to acknowledge receipt; hand delivered [or emailed] on (date) at (time)."
"Note: If an employee is on extended leave, consideration will be given to delivering the notice via certified mail and U.S."
Postal mail.
Contact the assigned LERN specialist to determine when to start calculating the first day of the Advance Notice period.
(7) Employees usually remain in a duty status during the Advance Notice period unless they are a seasonal employee who is placed in non-duty status due to lack of work.
"Note: For occasions when an employee may be placed on conduct-related administrative leave during the Advance Notice period (for example, their continued workplace presence may pose a threat to themselves or others, result in loss of or damage to government property, or otherwise jeopardize legitimate government interests), see Interim Guidance Memorandum HCO-06-0223-0004, Interim Guidance on Conduct-Related Administrative Leave, dated April 24, 2023."
"(8) In compliance with the IRM 6.630 series and the National Agreement, for BU employees, employees may request and receive approval for leave during the Advance Notice period."
"(9) Management may rescind and reissue an Advance Notice if, for example, new information is discovered that may result in an additional charge (reason) or specification and/or a more severe penalty, a procedural error is found, or there is a change in the nexus."
"If the Advance Notice is rescinded, the Advance Notice period restarts."
"(10) If an employee chooses to resign or submit a retirement application during the Advance Notice period, management must not rescind the proposal letter since a resignation or retirement can be withdrawn or cancelled any time before the effective date."
"6.752.1.22 (12-13-2024)
Crime Provision (Exception to 30-day Advance Notice Period)
(1) 5 CFR 752 authorizes an exception to the 30-calendar day Advance Notice period if management has reasonable cause to believe the employee committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed."
"This exception is referred to as the ""crime provision."""
(2) The crime provision allows the IRS to shorten the Advance Notice period if management proposes an indefinite suspension or a removal.
The Advance Notice period for a crime provision action is seven calendar days.
This also applies to NBU employees.
"All other procedural aspects of an adverse action apply; however, the timeframe to submit a written reply is shortened to seven calendar days."
"See IRM 6.752.1.21, Advance Notice (Proposal Letter)."
BU employees can also refer to Article 39 of the National Agreement.
"Note: Crime provision letters are drafted by a LERN specialist and must be reviewed by the appropriate Area Counsel, GLS, prior to obtaining signatures."
"(3) Reasonable cause describes a situation where the information at hand (evidence, for example) supports management’s belief that the employee committed a crime for which imprisonment may be imposed."
"A police arrest is not sufficient evidence by itself to establish a reasonable cause; however, a grand jury indictment, arrest, or detainment by a magistrate may be relied on to support reasonable cause."
"(4) Proposing an indefinite suspension based on an indictment under the crime provision allows management to defer a decision until judicial proceedings are completed and/or sufficient evidence is available for a removal, or the employee is cleared of the allegation."
"(5) If the misconduct occurred off duty and/or off government premises, there must be a nexus between the crime the employee is believed to have committed and the efficiency of the service."
The nexus must be stated in the Advance Notice (proposal letter).
There are exceptions.
"For example, if the employee is charged with an egregious act of misconduct or crime, such as murder, nexus can be presumed."
"(6) If management proposes a removal under the crime provision and the employee or their representative asserts that a written and/or oral reply to the proposed action would prejudice their defense in the criminal action, management and/or the LERN specialist will consult with Area Counsel, GLS, before the Proposing Official decides if the proposed removal should be replaced with an indefinite suspension."
Refusing to reply based on a belief that a written/oral reply would prejudice the employee's defense will not delay the action.
"(7) If management does not want to propose and/or take a removal action until the criminal proceedings are adjudicated and/or more evidence is received to support removal, management can consider proposing an indefinite suspension."
An indefinite suspension allows the employee to quickly be taken off rolls while the matter is being adjudicated and/or investigated.
"Unlike a removal, an indefinite suspension is not based on provable misconduct; it is based on the IRS’s reasonable cause belief that the employee committed a crime for which the sentence of imprisonment may be imposed."
"(8) In addition to the other requirements in IRM 6.752.1.21, Advance Notice (Proposal Letter), a crime provision Advance Notice for an indefinite suspension must include the following statements:

What condition(s) will end the action (for example, completion of an investigation or adjudication of the criminal matter)

A removal action may be proposed prior to ending the indefinite suspension, and

The employee is immediately being placed in a non-duty status, with pay, if management believes continuing to work may pose a threat to themselves or others, result in loss of or damage to government property, or otherwise jeopardize legitimate government interests, as stated in Interim Guidance Memorandum HCO-06-0223-0004, Interim Guidance on Conduct-Related Administrative Leave, dated April 24, 2023."
"6.752.1.23 (12-13-2024)
Oral/Written Reply
(1) The purpose of an oral and/or written reply is to give an employee and/or their representative an opportunity to present information in response to the proposed action in the Advance Notice (proposal letter) before a decision is made."
"Information may include, but is not limited to, a defense to their alleged misconduct, denial of any reasons for the proposed action, mitigating factors, and/or a request for a less severe action."
"There is no requirement for the employee or their representative, if applicable, to request an oral reply or provide a written reply."
An employee may choose to make both a written and an oral reply.
"Oral Reply – If the employee requests to have an oral reply, they may attend or not attend the reply."
The employee may include affidavits or other evidence in support of the oral reply.
"Any written documents (including attachments, if provided) are reviewed and considered by the Deciding Official prior to making a decision and are made part of the case file."
"Written Reply – If the employee chooses to submit a written reply, there is no requirement that it be in an affidavit form or under oath."
The employee may include affidavits or other evidence in support of the written reply.
"Any written documents (including attachments, if provided) are reviewed and considered by the Deciding Official prior to making a decision and are made part of the case file."
"(2) An employee in active-duty status is given a reasonable amount of time, as stated in the Advance Notice (proposal letter), to prepare for (for example, review material relied on, secure affidavits, if desired, write a reply) and present oral and/or written replies."
"(3) The Oral Reply Officer is the Deciding Official who may redelegate that authority, in compliance with Delegation Order 6-29."
"Note: CI employees see IRM 1.2.2.7.18.1, Criminal Investigation Deviation from Servicewide Delegation Order 6-29, Authority to Address Employee Performance or Conduct Issues."
"(4) To prepare for the Oral Reply, the Oral Reply Officer (ORO) will:

Consult with their assigned LERN specialist

Review the proposal letter and supporting documentation (material relied on/evidence), and

Review the appropriate National Agreement provisions if the subject of the action is a BU employee."
"(5) During the Oral Reply, the ORO will:

Listen

Ask questions to clarify factual matters, if needed, and

Not discuss or argue the merits of the proposed action or proposal letter."
"(6) After the Oral Reply, the ORO will review the verbatim transcript of the oral reply and edit, if needed."
"Note: For BU employees, per Article 39 of the National Agreement, verbatim transcripts are required for a suspension of more than 14 days, an indefinite suspension, a reduction in grade/band or pay, and a furlough of 30 days or less."
This provision also applies to NBU employees.
"(7) Prior to reaching a final decision on the proposed action, if the ORO:

Is not the Deciding Official, they will give a copy of the verbatim transcript to the Deciding Official who will follow the steps in IRM 6.752.1.1.3.2, Management Responsibilities, paragraph (11)."
"Is the Deciding Official, they will follow the steps in IRM 6.752.1.1.3.2, Management Responsibilities, paragraph (11)."
"(8) If management receives a request(s) to postpone the oral reply or more time to submit a written reply, they will promptly provide it to their assigned LERN specialist who will assist management with responding."
"Absent reasonable requests for more time, time periods should be enforced to avoid prolonging the Advance Notice period."
"6.752.1.24 (12-13-2024)
Supplemental Notice

Whichever is filed first is considered an election to continue in that forum.
"For information on MSPB appeals, go to the MSPB web site."
"For information on the EEO process, see “Where do I go for EEO?”."
"Note: If prior to filing an MSPB appeal, the employee or their representative and the IRS agree, in writing, to attempt to resolve the dispute through the EEO Alternative Dispute Resolution process, the time limit for filing an MSPB appeal is extended by 30 calendar days, for a total of 60 calendar days (5 CFR 1201.22, Filing an appeal and responses to appeals)."
"Note: BU employees or their representative may grieve allegations of discrimination consistent with 5 USC 7121, and Article 41 of the Addendum to the National Agreement."
"The employee or their representative may raise the matter under the statutory procedure or the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both (see29 CFR 1614.301, Relationship to negotiated grievance procedure)."

They may not grieve the same matter and appeal it in another forum.
The filing of an appeal in both forums will result in the dismissal whichever action is filed later.
"6.752.1.31 (12-13-2024)
Settling a Corrective Action
(1) After management issues a corrective action (for example, the decision letter), the employee and/or their representative may choose to discuss the possibility of an informal resolution, which can be done before a grievance or an appeal is filed, or arbitration is invoked."
"The time limit to file a grievance, an appeal, or invoke arbitration is not extended while informal discussions occur."
"Note: If the employee or their representative and the IRS agree, in writing, to attempt to resolve the dispute through the EEO Alternative Dispute Resolution process, prior to filing an MSPB appeal, the time limit for filing an MSPB appeal is extended by 30 calendar days, for a total of 60 calendar days (5 CFR 1201.22)."
(2) Management must contact their assigned LERN specialist if they want to settle a disciplinary/adverse action by mitigating (reducing) the original penalty if it is not related to a Section 1203 violation.
Note: Only the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has the authority to mitigate Section 1203 violations.
"(3) After an appeal is filed or arbitration is invoked, third-party settlements are worked in collaboration with LERN management, and Area Counsel, GLS."
Management must contact their assigned LERN specialist for guidance.
Note: Only the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has the authority to mitigate Section 1203 violations.
"(4) Any settlement or Last Chance agreement is drafted by a LERN specialist and reviewed by the appropriate Area Counsel, GLS, prior to obtaining signatures."
"Note: For BU employees, Articles 5 and 8 of the National Agreement, NTEU is entitled to attend Last Chance meetings and any settlement discussions about a Last Chance agreement."
"See Article 5, Section 18, of the National Agreement, for minimum terms required in a Last Chance agreement."

"(2) If an employee fails to return to duty after a reasonable period (for example, 10 calendar days), management should ask the employee if they plan to continue their employment or if they are resigning."
"If they do not return to duty or resign or if they cannot be reached by telephone or letter, management can separate the employee from federal service without taking an adverse action."
"(3) If management becomes aware that an employee wants to return to work, it must not separate them based on abandonment of position."
"Note: The IRS does not normally use an abandonment-of-position action because, if the employee returns to duty and claims they did not abandon their position, OPM usually accepts their word, and the employee must be restored to duty."
"After the employee is restored to duty, management can begin the discipline or adverse action procedures for leave violations, if appropriate."
"6.752.1.33 (12-13-2024)
Employee Death
(1) The corrective action process ceases upon receipt of an employee’s proof of death, which may include an SF-50, Notification of Personnel Action."

Moratoriums on Addressing Misconduct Matters
(1) Types of moratoriums:

National Emergency - If the president declares a national emergency, such as the Coronavirus Disease pandemic, the IRS Human Capital Officer will determine if a moratorium on actions related to a misconduct is appropriate and announce the beginning and ending dates."
"Natural Disaster - If the president or other appropriate authority (for example, city or state official) declares a geographic area as a natural disaster, the business-based human resources staff (embedded) will collaborate with LERN and the Senior Commissioner’s Representative to determine if a moratorium is appropriate and announce the beginning and ending dates."
"Note: Natural disasters are defined as any natural catastrophe (for example, hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mud slide, snowstorm, or drought), or any fire, flood, or explosion, regardless of the cause, in any part of the United States, which the president or city/state official declares is causing damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance to help alleviate the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused by the disaster."
"Depending on the severity of the incident (for example, explosion, fire), this may include a terrorist attack."
"Winter Holiday Season - Annually for four weeks during the winter holidays, beginning two Mondays before December 25 and ending in January, two Fridays after December 25 (for example, December 16, 2024, through January 10, 2025)."
(2) What Occurs During a Moratorium - a moratorium does not prohibit all actions.
Management may continue with certain actions if appropriate.
"When a moratorium is in place, managers continue to work with a LERN specialist to begin addressing misconduct or continue addressing misconduct actions already in progress."
"During a moratorium, for employees not serving a probationary/trial period or a temporary/term appointment, managers will consider and decide whether the following activities should be held in abeyance or if they should continue."
"Signing/issuing an Advance Notice (proposal letter)

Signing/issuing a Final Decision (decision letter)

Interviewing/questioning an employee about misconduct

Issuing grievance replies/decisions

Holding grievance meetings

Conducting oral replies

If an employee began serving a suspension before the moratorium was effective, they continue serving the suspension until their return to duty date."
"6.752.1.35 (12-13-2024)

Records Retention
(1) Copies of the Advance Notice, material relied on, any oral/written replies, any supporting material, and the decision are maintained by LERN in a case file."
"See 5 USC 7503, Cause and procedure."
"(2) LERN retains case files for six years in compliance with Document 12829, General Records Schedules (GRS; see 2.3, Employee Relations Records)."
"Note: All records and documentation (e-mail, electronic documents, system printouts, etc.)"
"relevant to the misconduct case must be kept until all appeal periods have expired, which may be longer than the six-year period."
"(3) In compliance with the GRS, 2.2, Employee Management Records, management annually reviews Drop Files and destroys superseded documents."
Drop Files are kept for one year after an employee separates or transfers to another agency.
"After the one-year retention period, the file is destroyed."
"Note: Management must keep relevant records in the Drop File if they are needed in connection with a grievance, appeal, or judicial proceeding."
(4) The SF-50 for adverse actions taken under 5 CFR 752 is a permanent record filed in the employee’s OPF.

Policy
It is IRS policy to support an environment in which employees or grievants may express concern(s) informally or use this IRM to seek a formal resolution."
"Employees may file grievances without fear of restraint, interference, coercion or discrimination."
Grievances are to be fairly and objectively considered and processed timely.
Most grievances are addressed within the business unit’s management chain.
"On occasion, grievances may be addressed outside the grievant’s management chain (e.g., if the remedy cannot be granted by the grievant’s management chain)."
A grievance will not be elevated to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) or the Deputy Commissioner unless the grievant reports directly to them.
"If an executive (i.e., Senior Executive Service (SES), Administratively Determined and Streamlined Critical Pay), the head of the business unit, Deputy Commissioner or Commissioner is the GDO, there is only one grievance step."
"Management may grant up to four hours of administrative time to grievants and authorized representatives to discuss, prepare and present the grievance."
No more than four hours of administrative time is allowed regardless of the number of steps the grievance involves.
Note: Grievants (and authorized representatives (if applicable)) must request and receive approval for administrative time in advance.
"6.771.1.3 (08-29-2025)
Moratoriums on Agency Grievance Matters
Types of moratoriums:
National Emergency - If the president declares a national emergency, such as the coronavirus disease pandemic, the IRS Human Capital Officer will decide if a moratorium on LR/ER activity (e.g., conduct or performance issues/actions) is appropriate and announce the beginning and ending dates."
"Natural Disaster - If the president or other appropriate authority (e.g., city or state official) declares a geographic area as a natural disaster, the business-based human resources staff (also known as embedded) will collaborate with LERN and the Senior Commissioner’s Representative to determine if a moratorium is appropriate and announce the beginning and ending dates."
"Note: Natural disasters are defined as any natural catastrophe (e.g., hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mud slide, snowstorm, or drought), or any fire, flood, or explosion, regardless of the cause, in any part of the United States, which the president or city/state official declares is causing damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance to help alleviate the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused by the disaster."
"Depending on the severity of the incident (e.g., explosion or fire), this may include a terrorist attack."
"Winter Holiday Season - Annually during the winter holidays, beginning two Mondays before December 25 and ending in January, two Fridays after December 25 (e.g., December 16, 2024, through January 10, 2025)."

Management may continue with LR/ER activity if appropriate.
"When a moratorium is in place, managers continue to work with a LERN specialist on LR/ER activity already in progress."
"During a moratorium, for employees not serving a probationary/trial period or a temporary/term appointment, managers will consider and decide whether the following activities should be held in abeyance or if they should continue."
"- Issuing grievance replies/decisions
- Holding grievance meetings
6.771.1.4 (08-29-2025)
Grievant’s Representative
Employees may choose a representative who is willing to serve and allowed by the GDO (see IRM 6.771.1.5, Disallowing Grievant’s Representative)."
Employees may designate a representative at any grievance step.
Designation of the grievant’s representative must be in writing and given to the GDO.
Only one individual may serve as an employee’s representative.
Grievants may change the designation of a representative at any time.
"6.771.1.5 (08-29-2025)
Disallowing Grievant’s Representative
The IRS will allow grievants to choose a representative unless such choice:
Creates a conflict of interest or position - This occurs when the representative’s IRS duties conflict with the functions of the representative."
"For example, when a GDO’s manager is chosen by the grievant to serve as his/her representative."
Imposes unreasonable costs to the government - This can include any travel costs or expenses requested by the representative to fulfill his/her role.
Conflicts with the priority needs of the IRS - The IRS mission takes precedence.
The requested representative may be disallowed if a priority work assignment precludes his/her release from official duties.
Use the same criteria as approving annual leave.
"If applicable, within 15 calendar days of receiving the grievant’s written designation of representative, the GDO will provide a written disallowance decision to the grievant and the disallowed representative."
The disallowance decision includes the grievant’s appeal rights and becomes part of the case file.
"Within 15 calendar days of receiving the disallowance decision, the grievant (not the disallowed representative) may appeal the disallowance decision by:
Submitting a written appeal (via email) to LERN’s Field Operations Deputy Director named in the disallowance decision."
"To find the name of the Deputy Director of Field Operations, see Labor/Employee Relations & Negotiations Contacts."
Attaching a copy of the disallowance decision to his/her appeal.
"Within 20 calendar days of receiving the appeal of the disallowance decision, the LERN Field Operations Deputy Director will make and communicate a final decision on either allowing or disallowing the representative."
"The disallowance decision is not grievable, and the grievance process resumes after the decision is issued."
"6.771.1.6 (08-29-2025)
Employee Coverage
Agency grievances cover the following individuals:
Current NBU employees,
Current BU employees if the grievance issue is not covered under the NA (e.g., the ranking procedures used to fill a supervisory position) and

"6.771.1.7 (08-29-2025)
Grievance Coverage
Except as listed below, agency grievances apply to matters relating to the employment of a covered employee that is subject to management’s control."

"6.771.1.8 (08-29-2025)
Grievance - Step 1
Before filing a formal grievance, employees are encouraged to seek informal resolution as soon as possible and no later than 14 calendar days from the event or the date the employee became aware of the matter being grieved."
Note: Seeking informal resolution does not extend the timeframe to file a formal grievance.
"In the event a formal grievance is filed, the GDO, the grievant (and the representative (if applicable)) will try to resolve the grievance at the lowest level of the grievance process."
"If an employee chooses to formally grieve a personal work-related issue (other than a disciplinary action), he/she must complete Form 5877 and provide it to the second-level manager within 20 calendar days of the event or the date the employee became aware of the matter being grieved."
Employees should present a matter of personal concern about a continuing practice/condition as soon as possible.
"Note: For grievances on disciplinary actions, see IRM 6.771.1.9, Grievance - Step 2."
"Upon receipt of Form 5877, the second-level manager will contact LERN to discuss the grievance and next steps (See IRM 6.771.1.1.3, Responsibilities, paragraph 4, for LERN contact information)."
The second-level manager will review Form 5877 to decide if he/she has the authority to provide the remedy requested.
"If the second-level manager cannot provide the relief requested, he/she will provide Form 5877 and any supporting documents to the proper GDO within seven calendar days."
Note: The Step 1 manager may delegate the grievance to a GDO at a lower level.
"In addition, the Step 1 GDO may be outside the grievant's management chain if the remedy cannot be granted by the grievant’s management chain."
"The Step 1 GDO procedures:
Within 10 calendar days of receiving Form 5877, review the grievance and any supporting documentation, and if necessary, issue a written threshold decision."
"See IRM 6.771.1.10, Threshold Information."
"Within 15 calendar days of receiving Form 5877, hold a Step 1 meeting with the grievant (and his/her representative (if applicable)) if there are no threshold issues, to consider the issue(s) and the remedy requested."
"Within 15 calendar days of holding the grievance meeting, issue a written decision."
"The written decision will include:
- A summary of the Step 1 issue(s),
- A summary of the consideration given to the issue(s),

"Introduction
Globally, developing human resources in an organization is a priority."
Human resources development offers the employees the ability to handle a variety of assignments in the workplace.
"Apart from the individual benefits, human resources development enhances the ability of an organization to compete and adapt to a changing competitive environment."
"In other to meet the goal of sustained competitive advantage, organizations over the years have designed a human resources development technique in which managers play the role of mentors to less experienced employees in the workplace."
Managers as mentors in an organization entail a process in which managers establish a relationship between them and individuals in the first stages of their careers.
"Mentoring is more or less a learning relationship in which the managers share technical information, institutional knowledge and insights with employees."
Informal mentoring relationship may develop in an organization in which a manager takes a new junior and less experienced employee ‘under his or her wing’.
Formal mentoring programme allow organizations to create and nurture those relationships by matching managers with less experienced employees to meet specific organizational goals while at the same time helping those in mentoring relationship to identify and develop their own talent.
Formal mentoring relationship is dynamic and unique but differs substantially between organizations.
The difference is to a very large extent determined by what the organization produces or service rendered.
For instances a mentoring programme designed to enhance the recruitment and retention of a mechanical engineer is bound to look different from one intended to improve the quality of a psychiatric nurse.
"However, there are some basic elements that should be incorporated into every mentoring programme."
"Apart from those basic elements, the function of mentoring is similar and of similar importance to organizations in which a mentoring relationship is formally introduced."
It is these basic elements and the functions of mentoring among others that constitute the main thrust of this discourse.
"Mentor andMentoring: AConceptualClarification
Mentor as a concept has its traditional origin from the Greek mythology."
"According to legend, Mentor was a figure in Homer’s Odyssey."
"Mentor was the name of a wise and trusted counselor to whom Odysseus (also known as Ulysses) entrusted the care, tutoring and protection of his son, Telemachus while he Odysseus embarked on his famous wanderings."
It was these wanderings that took him to the Trojan wars and other places that the word ‘odyssey’ in our present day usage drives its meaning.
"The Greek archetype had it that, Athena the Greek goddess of wisdom did."
"assume Mentor’s form for the purpose of guiding, teaching counseling and protecting the young Telemachus."
This archetype offers provocative insights into the meaning of mentor as transcending gender and patriarchal understandings.
"In ordinary usage, the term mentor typically was used by the recipients of the counsel, teaching, protection etc to refer to the person providing them."
Observers of such counseling and tutoring have also been known to label certain persons as mentors.
"This labeling becomes obvious in a situation in which an older influential person takes a younger person with potentials ‘under his wing’ so to speak, for the purpose of protecting, counseling and tutoring."
"While the person providing the services is known as a mentor, the younger person that is befitting from the relationship is known as a protégé or mentee."
"From the term Mentor, the concept of mentoring is derived."
"Mentoring refers to the patterned behavior or process whereby a person acts.as a mentor to a protégé or mentee who enjoys protection, counseling and tutoring from the mentor."
"The Greek mythological and historical context of mentor and mentoring portrays the concepts as informal, unofficial, voluntary, mutually agreeable and self selected interaction between the mentor and the mentee."
"It should be noted that while the roots of mentor and mentoring is traced to mythology, mentoring is no myth."
It is a very real relationship that has been an integral part of social life.
"From the traditional manifestation of informal mentor and mentoring, the process has become a programme that has gained momentum in the."
management and human resource development literature.
Mentoring has become an institutionalized strategy that generally refers to a. situation in an organization in which a relationship exists between a less experienced individual known as the mentee or protégé and a more experienced individual known as the mentor (Kram 1985).
The traditional mentoring model is viewed as a dyadic face-to-face long term relationship between a mentor and a mentee.
"However, the structure of modem mentoring can be a network of multiple mentors (Burlew 1991, Bird and Didon 1992)."
Formal mentoring relationship involves assigned pairings of mentor with their mentees or protégés.
This is not the case with informal mentoring relationships.
Its development is necessitated by mutual identification and interpersonal comfort (Ragins 2002).
Formal mentoring programmes match individuals as part of a development process and the individuals must then strive to get to know one another.
"Formal mentoring relationships are part of an organized, facilitated development programme for a specified duration in which mentees are generally prompted to have developmental goals in mind."
It is within these developmental goals that formal mentoring must initiate interaction and establish rapport (Gaskil 1993).
"Managers as Mentors in FormalOrganisations
In an organization, mentoring relationships exists between managers especially at mid points of their careers and other employees in the first stages of their careers."
"In this relationship, the managers as mentors aid the mentees by impacting technical, interpersonal, political skills and other aspects of knowledge on the mentee."
"As mentors, the managers play a versatile role in this relationship (Zelditch 1990)."
It is a relationship designed in such a way that the managers provide personal and professional supports to the mentees.
"The managers, who are always more experienced than the mentees, make use of their experience in a facilitative way to support the development of the mentees (Hymowitz 1995, Baugh & Scandura 1999)."
"In other for the manager as a mentor to effectively and successfully share technical information, institutional knowledge and insight with the mentee in an organization, the manager must possess certain qualities."
It is worthwhile to note that the attributes of the manager as mentor encompasses both personal and professional qualities.
See figure 1:1 below.
"With these qualities in place, he is able to help the mentee identify with his."
"organization and professional environment, maintain confidentiality and ensure that communications are clear, open and reciprocal."
A combination of the personal and professional qualities of the manager as a mentor is subsumed into three mentoring dispositions which are essential to effective mentoring.
"The mentoring dispositions are:
Firstly, the manager as mentor must be prepared to open his or her self to the mentees by sharing their reasons and decision processes with them and allowing themselves to be observed."
"Secondly, the manager has the skills and abilities to match the support they give with the mentee’s developing knowledge and understanding, thereby leading incrementally;
Thirdly, the manager as a mentor should be able to express care and concern."
He should also be able to demonstrate empathy for the mentee’s situation.
"It is should be noted that the effectiveness of the mentoring relationship is not only dependent on the qualities and the role of the manager, but also on the qualities and role of the mentee."
The mentee among other qualities must have genuine interest in personal growth and professional development.
He must have strong potentials and commitment to learning and acquiring new skills and be willing to take risk as part of the learning process.
"The role of mentee must incorporate among others, the ability to develop mutually agreeable goals for the mentoring relationship that are specific, measureable, achievable, realistic and timely."
"Phases in Mentoring
Managers in an organization used the mentoring relationship to assist employees at specific stages of development or transition and lasts for a sustained but defined period of time."
"Inmost cases, the mentoring period is in four phases namely: initiation, cultivation, separation and redefinition phases."
"(Kram, 1983)."
"The mentoring relationship is not only facilitative, supportive and developmental but also offers the managers some level of benefits."
"In other words, the mentoring relationship provides developmental opportunity for both parties and can thus be of mutual benefits (Koonce 1994)."
• Initiation Phase: The first phase of the mentoring relationship is known as the phase of initiation.
The initiation period is between 6-12 months.
It is in this stage that the employee admires the manager’s competence.
The mentee also in this stage recognizes the manager (mentor) as his or her source of support and guidance.
"The manager on the other hand, identifies and realizes that the employee is someone with potentials and as such can be mentored."
This stage is crucial to the mentoring relationship between the manager and the employee.
It is this phase that determines the success of the mentoring.
"• Cultivation Phase: Upon the identification and realization of the potentials of the mentee, the manager proceeds to the cultivation phase."
The cultivation stage takes about 2-5 years.
It is a stage when the actual mentoring takes place.
The manager provides challenging work and assignments.
It is also at this stage too that the manager ensures that mentee is protected and he provides sponsorship.
"in this second phase, the mentee gains self confidence, new attitudes, values and styles of operation."
• Separation Phase: The phase spans between 6-12 months.
"In this stage, the manager as a mentor demonstrates his success at developing management talent as he move apart from the mentee."
"Another fundamental feature of the separation phase is that the employee begins to experience independence and autonomy and at times he experiences feelings of turmoil, anxiety and loss of time."
It should be noted that the feelings do not bring about any form of regret on the part of the mentee.
"• Redefinition Phase: This is the last phase and, it has no definite time span."
"The mentoring relationship is on till the manager leaves the job either by change ofjob, retirement or death."
This is why this stage is also referred to as ongoing stage.
"In this phase, the manager continues to be supportive, takes pride in the accomplishments of the mentee."
The mentee on his or her part responds with gratitude for what he or she has gained from the mentoring relationship over the years.
"One basic characteristics of this phase is that the mentoring relationship in most cases, inevitably give way and the relationship becomes that of friendship and true professional colleagues."
"The Benefits ofMentoring to the Mentee and the Manager
In a formal mentoring relationship, mentoring provides two fundamental functions."
The functions are career functions and the psychosocial functions.
The career functions cut across a range of behaviours’ that help the mentee to learn the ropes and prepare the mentee for hierarchical advancement within an organization.
"This advancement is achieved through coaching the mentee, sponsoring, increasing his or her positive exposure and viability and offering them protection and challenging assignments (Bazionelos 2004)."
The career function is highly dependent on the manager’s position and influence in the organization.
"In most cases, the career functions are a stronger predictor of the mentee compensation and advancement."
A Meta Analysis conducted by Allen et al (2004) shows that mentored individuals have more protection receive more promotion and earn higher salaries than their non mentored counterpart.
"In addition to these instrumental outcomes, mentees report more career satisfaction, career commitment, job satisfaction and greater expectations for advancement than those that are not in any form of mentoring relationships (Scandura 1992)."
The psychosocial functions of mentoring are more personal than professional.
This mentoring function relies on an emotional bond between the manager (mentor) and the junior and less experienced employee (mentee).
"Psychosocial functions are built on trust, intimacy and interpersonal bonds in the relationship and sometimes include behaviours that can enhance the identity, self worth and self efficacy of the mentee."
"The mentee also derive psychosocial functions such as offering acceptance, confirmation and providing counseling, friendship and role modeling (Wanberg et al 2006)."
"The mentoring functions are not restricted to the mentee only, the mentor also have some kind of benefit."
"The mentoring relationship offers the manager improved job performance, career success and revitalization, recognition by others, a loyal base of support from the mentee and a sense of personal fulfillment and satisfaction (Noe 1988, Mullen & Noe 1999)."
"It also offers the manager the opportunity and exposure to new ideas, technologies and perspectives through development of new professional and organizational contacts."
"It should be noted however that similar to the rising star effect, the benefits associated with being a mentor may be a function of pre existing differences between managers who chose to be mentors and non mentors."
Managers who chose to become mentors are high performing established stars who already experience high level of career success as well as positive job and career attitude.
"Furthermore, high performing managers may be drawn to organizations that offer climates and assignments that lead to positive career outcomes (Ragins & Verbos 2007)."
It is worthy to mention that the benefits that accrue to the manager as a mentor and his mentee is influenced largely by the characteristics of those in the mentoring relationship and organizational support.
"This happens through three mechanism-selection, evocation and manipulation."
Selection refers to who the manager selects as a mentee.
"Evocation has to do with the responses that are evoked from others, while manipulation reflects how individual shape in the course of their mentoring relationship (Ragins & Scandura 1999)."
"Since the onus of selection (matching a mentor and a mentee) in most formal mentoring relationship lies with the organization, two personality characteristics of pro-activity and
openness to experience are fundamental."
The mechanisms of evocation and manipulation of interactions within a formal mentoring context is dependent on the personality characteristics.
The pro-activity of the mentee purportedly affects the amount of mentoring.
Through initiation and maintenance of scheduled meetings between the mentor and mentee in terms of evocation and through goal-oriented behavior during mentor interactions are achieved.
"Openness to experience has to do with imagination, intelligence, originality and open mindedness."
It is a very crucial factor that determines the level of outcome in both career and psychosocial functioning.
"Through evocation and manipulations, the mentee with higher openness to experience are more inquisitive and receptive to new ideas and perspectives from a manager (mentor) that the mentee may not have gravitated to on their own accord."
High openness to experience is similarly predispose managers to be more willing to mentor a mentee that is not a mirror reflection of themselves and also have the openness to evoke more comfortable atmosphere for self disclosure (Coley 1996).
"Conclusion
The discourse sufficiently reveals that a mentoring relationship exist between managers and employees in the first stage of their career."
This relationship is different from every other form of relationship in the workplace.
What distinguishes it from other forms of personal relationship is that a mentoring relationship is a developmental relationship that is embedded within the career context.
It is a relationship that is focused on the development process that allows the organizations to create and nurture the relationship between the manager and less experienced employee to meet specific organizational objectives while helping the mentee to identify and develop its own talents.
"The monitoring relationship between the manager and the less experienced employee, no doubt, is of immerse mutual benefits to the mentee and the manager."
"Apart from the mutual benefits, the organization in which the mentoring relationship is anchored has some benefits too."
It serves as methods of deliberate and systematic knowledge transfer.
"It also provides a forum for providing job specific knowledge and insight for those positions requiring experience, judgement, discretion and soft skills in order to be effectively achieved."
The level of benefits that accrue to the mentee and the organization is not dependent on the qualities and role of the manager only but also on the organization in which the mentoring relationship is taking place.
"In other to achieve considerable benefits from mentoring, the organizations must state the desired outcome and ensure that they identify a key contact person who will coordinate and be responsible for follow through on establishing, supporting and maintaining the mentoring programmes."

Dedication




First, we dedicate this book to our clients."
You are the leaders who partner with us to conduct employee opinion surveys.
Then you use the results to create environments where employees love to come to work and customers love to do business.
"Your engaged employees look forward to going to work, will give their discretionary effort, and will go to the wall to ensure that you, and your organization, are successful."
You truly make a significant difference to your employees and customers.
We thank you!
"Secondly, we dedicate this book to all the bosses who do not see a need to listen to their employees’ feedback or act on their opinions–– much less continuously strive to improve their departments and organizations."
"As one senior manager told us when we tried to explain the value of an employee opinion survey, “I already know what the employees think and I don’t plan on changing if I learn something new.” It is these managers who lose touch with reality, don’t even know they have lost touch with reality, and unknowingly produce poor working environments."
It is this group of managers who make the leaders listed previously look like heroes.
"When their environment turns sour enough—measured by a lack of productivity, teamwork, communication, quality, service, and profitability—these managers willingly turn to us for help."
"We thank you, too."
"Finally, on October 21, 2006, Joe Prandini, CEO andgeneralmanager of Betteravia Farms, one of the largest farmers and packers of produce in the United States, passed away."
"For 15 years, we partnered with Betteravia and have seen firsthand the power of Joe’s great leadership."
"A true gift to the spirit, Joe possessed a compelling and positive vision for his organization’s future."
"He built strong, caring relationships that led people to enthusiastically follow him to achieve the shared vision."
"When we talked to Joe about what the great organizations we worked with were doing to create workplace excellence, Joe used to say, “That is really powerful stuff."
You ought to write about it.” All who knew Joe will miss him.
"Joe, this book is also for you."

Introduction




If you desire to be the type of leader who creates an environment where your employees love to come to work and your customers love doing business, The Only Leadership Book You’ll Ever Need is the book for you."
"For the past 20 years, we at Peter Barron Stark Companies have taken great pride in being a leading management consulting firm that works with all types of organizations to build a great work environment."
"During this time, we have conducted more than 250 different organizational assessments, and gathered and analyzed the opinions of more than 100,000 managers and employees from hundreds of organizations around the world."
"We have interpreted the opinions of these people and provided hard data to leaders in banking, manufacturing, high-tech, healthcare, pharmaceutical, professional sports, law, retail, food service, and many other diverse industries."
"When we’re asked what employees think about their jobs, organizations, immediate supervisors, and management, we can answer the question with confidence."
We know the secrets of Best-of-the-Best organizations.
We see what their leaders do to engage employees.
"In The Only Leadership Book You’ll Ever Need, you will learn about the 10 key attributes that differentiate Best-of-the-Best organizations (those in the top quartile) from the other three-quarters of the companies that comprise the rest of the pack (Chapter 2)."
"You will read about the 11 stupid things managers do to undermine workplace


excellence (Chapter 4), and what can be done to recover from those mistakes and move into a positive leadership role (Chapter 5)."
"We’ll share the techniques that leaders can use to single-handedly make a difference, even in the most difficult situations."
"Finally, we’ll give you 76 strategies to achieve workplace excellence (Chapter 6)."
We have watched our clients use them and have measured their success.
We know these strategies work!
"If you are a leader who is focused on the future and understands that you can’t reach your full leadership potential without the commitment and loyalty of engaged employees, read on."
"Because the truth is this: If people do not willingly follow you, you will be a manager, but not a leader."
"Whether you feel members of your team walk on water or are just barely keeping their heads above the waves, our findings will convince you that knowing what your employees think, and knowing the most important actions to take to create workplace excellence, are absolutely critical to ensure your success as a leader."
The Winning Numbers: Benchmarking the Best in Class Our expertise is understanding your workforce.
We partner with clients to help them identify and implement best practices and figure out how to achieve optimum results through a powerful team.
Our goal is to make you an employer of choice.
That means the best people will want to work for you and contribute to your organization’s goals.
"With a contracting workforce and expanding competition, that’s a worthy
goal."
"So you need a starting point, a benchmark, to find out how your employees view their workplace and your management team."
"After all, you can’t improve if you don’t know your areas of strength, much less your areas of weakness."
Benchmarking is a valuable tool that allows you to compare the results of your survey against the results of other organizations.
You know the approach.
A group of companies measures key indicators for success.
"The indicators are reported and aggregated, and the benchmark numbers are produced."
"Using the scale, the top-performing companies become the best in class."
"We utilize two separate benchmarks to guide our clients’ successes in building workplace excellence: the Overall Benchmark of all companies, and the Best-of-the-Best Benchmark that isolates the top 25 percent (highest-rated) organizations surveyed."
Remember all those industries we have surveyed?
"Because of our wide reach across diverse fields, our benchmarks are broadly representative of the attitudes and opinions of many employees."
The survey results also capture the management practices of good-to-great companies.
We can say this with confidence because companies that do not place much value on employee satisfaction do not conduct surveys.
It is highly unlikely they can achieve the status of a good-to great employer.
An employee opinion survey provides the objective data you need to identify employee attitudes and take action to become an employer of choice.
"More than that, you will surround yourself with satisfied team members who are engaged in their work, creative with solutions, and generally pleasant to be around."
That’s how you spend your time and your energy on being a leader who produces results.
"After collecting data from thousands of employees, consistent response patterns pinpointed the areas where the Best-of-the-Best excel."
"Using the survey data and the themes that emerged from personal interviews with employees and managers, we identified the key areas that differentiated these leading organizations from those in the Overall Benchmark."
What Makes the Best-of-the-Best the Best?
What are the trendsetters doing to achieve superior results?
"In the years we have been conducting employee opinion surveys, the bar is continually being raised for the Best-of-the-Best Benchmark."
"Currently, at a minimum, an organization needs to have an overall favorable response rate of 82 percent to make the cut and be considered among the Best-of-the-Best."
"Our surveys measure employee engagement and satisfaction in what we call “percent favorable,” which combines the percent of “strongly agree” plus “agree” responses."
"For employee opinion surveys, we are more concerned with whether employees are in agreement


with statements in the survey (strongly agree and agree) than we are with the strength of the agreement."
"For example, in reviewing the responses to the following statement: “Senior management has clearly communicated the company’s strategic direction to me,” 83.8 percent of all survey respondents strongly agreed or agreed."
There are 100 questions in the majority of surveys we conduct.
"Out of these 100 questions, the results often show a substantial difference between companies in the Best-of-the-Best Benchmark and those in the Overall Benchmark."
You’ll see the differences when you read Chapter 2 (“The 10 Keys to Workplace Excellence”).
"The difference between the favorable ratings in the Overall Benchmark and the ratings in the Best-of-the-Best Benchmark in these 10 key areas ranged from 9.7 to 29.3 percentage points, and averaged 14 points difference per question between the two benchmarks."
"Over time, as we presented survey data to our clients, they asked us, “Are our results good?” and “How do we compare to the best organizations?” You will find the answers to these questions in the following chapters."
"We will review the benchmark data, identify what the Best-of-the- Best companies do compared with others, and add in our analysis of the best practices."
The result will give you the tools you need to join the leaders in the Best-of-the-Best Benchmark.
"How We Can Help You Succeed
If you were a client, here is what we would do."
"To identify areas of strength and deficit, we would design a customized employee opinion survey for distribution to managers and employees."
"They rate their perceptions of the support they get to do their best work, which provides the quantitative data."
The results of their employee opinion survey are often a revelation for many organizations.
Then we would conduct in-person interviews with both line employees and managers to obtain qualitative information.
"With their input, we could discover the major issues affecting the company’s employee performance and, therefore, the company’s performance."
"Finally, based on the results of the survey and the interviews, we would help you improve your company’s support of employees and, concurrently, your employees’ support of customers."
"By implementing action plans and utilizing executive coaching strategies, we would help your managers become even better leaders and your organizations achieve their goals."
What is the situation at your company?
Maybe there is an employees-related problem to solve.
Or perhaps you want to know how the best companies take care of their workers.
"Maybe you realize that, to rise to the next level in your career, you need to improve your team’s performance."
You’ve come to the right place.
We’re going to share with you the benchmark data along with the insights gained from two decades of interviewing and coaching leaders.
You’ll learn what employees think about the best managers and their organizations.
"Most importantly, you’ll see what you can do to become a respected leader who produces results."
"Part 1
The CASE
for
WORKPLACE EXCELLENCE






Become the Employer of Choice






The bottom line rules business."
"If you want to generate more profit, you need employees who are engaged with their jobs."
Why?
"Motivated to improve your product and your service, they want to come to work."
"Even better, their positive attitude is contagious."
"These workers achieve results, which earns money for your company."
"Furthermore, they want to stay with you because they feel fulfilled in their work."
You are their employer of choice.
"Employees with an above-average attitude toward their work will generate higher customer satisfaction, higher productivity, and higher profits for their organizations."
"In addition, companies with higher morale (more than 70 percent) outperformed those in the same industries by 11.3 percent.1 It’s clear that maintaining a vital, engaged workforce has a significant impact on the bottom line."
"Workforce Woes
As we write this, the economy is in a downturn and many employ- ees with concerns about layoffs might be doing their best in order to save their jobs."
"However, when the economy improves, employment choices in many industries will be plentiful, but engaged employees are less likely


to look for other employment opportunities and walk away with all the training and experience you’ve provided."
That is important to remember because the cost of replacing an employee is staggering.
Most human resources professionals estimate a cost of between 70 percent and 200 percent of an employee’s annual salary to replace lost talent.
Dealing with low morale is a time- consuming headache.
Why do it when you don’t have to?
"An employer of choice measures employee engagement and satisfaction, and takes action to address key areas of concern."
"When employees know you listen, care, and will respond to their feedback, they will choose you."
Here is something else to keep in mind: There will be a worker shortage in the future.
"Though the statistics vary, all current research projects a shrinking workforce."
How will you compete if you can’t hire and retain high-quality workers?
Perhaps an even bigger price is paid by the brain drain that occurs when employees leave and take their knowledge and training with them.
"Employee attrition costs you personally in the effort to hire and train, and it costs your team members as they first compensate for a missing position, then spend time training the new recruit."
"Based on research conducted in 2009 by Right Management, the talent and management expert within Manpower, 60 percent of your employees intend to leave when the job market in their geographic location regains strength, and an additional one-in-four are networking and updating their resumes."
"Douglas J. Matthews, President and CEO at Right Management states, “Employees are clearly expressing their pent up frustration with how they have been treated through the downturn."
"While employers may have taken the necessary steps of streamlining operations to remain viable, it appears that many employees may have felt neglected in the process."
"The result is a disengaged and disgruntled workforce.”2
Then there are the demographics."
"In 2006, Baby Boomers (ap- proximately 76 million people born between 1946 and 1964) began to turn 60."
"In the year 2008, workers ages 55 and older accounted for
18.1 percent of our workforce."
"According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, by 2018 they will make up approximately 23.9 percent of the workforce."
"Then they’ll retire.3


Baby Boomers leaving the workplace is significant not only because of the skill sets they take with them, but because of the decline in the birth rate of successive generations."
"There are fewer Generation X-ers, Generation Y-ers, and Millenials to take their places."
"Watch Employees Leave
When we asked employees why they begin searching for a new job, the following responses were given most frequently:
 The supervisor or manager does not value the employee’s contribution or appear to care about the employee."
" The supervisor does not provide good, ongoing communication to the employee."
 The supervisor does not provide the employee with performance feedback.
 The supervisor is late on the performance appraisal.
 The supervisor treats the employee disrespectfully.
 The supervisor fails to provide the employee with clear direction.
 The employee feels there is little potential for career development.
 The employee is ready for a more challenging position or a new experience.
 The employee seeks better compensation and benefits.
"Many of these reasons are within the manager’s control, yet when we interview managers and ask why their people departed for another organization, the most frequent response given is a higher salary."
"Most times, the managers state that they had no hope of keeping the employee from jumping ship because they had no control over matching the employee’s higher salary offer."
"When we interview employees who leave, it’s a different story."
"Most employees who leave organizations do receive a higher salary, but the


amount of the increase is surprising: The average salary increase is approximately 6 percent."
"Ask yourself this question: If you loved your job and your boss really valued your contributions, would you risk all that to go to work for another organization for just a 6-percent increase in salary?"
"When employees answer this question, most think about it for a moment and then say, “No.” But what if you did not love your job and you had a bad boss?"
"In this situation, a 6-percent increase in salary would seem like an opportunity you would not want to pass up."
"In most instances, people leave because they lack a meaningful working relationship with an immediate supervisor."
It’s not the money.
"The stronger this relationship is, the lesser role money will play when an employee considers leaving the company for a competing offer."
"The Employee Who Isn’t There
There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only two ways employees leave an organization."
"Sometimes it is physically, as in moving on to a competitor, which is manageable; at least you know the employee is no longer on your team."
You are clear on the next step: hire a great employee to take over the job.
"The second way is the one that strikes fear into the heart of every manager: the employee who mentally quits, but stays with the organization."
There are five warning signs to help you determine your employees’ level of engagement and give you a “heads up” that an employee has mentally resigned.
"They are:
 Evidence of a “whatever” attitude."
"The employee is not confrontational, but clearly is not motivated."
 Minimal contribution that produces a mediocre level of performance.
"The employee shows up right on time, leaves right on time, and does just enough to keep his or her job, and no more."
 Absenteeism.
"The employee uses up all sick, vacation, or PTO (personal time off) time on a regular basis."
 Loss of enthusiasm.
"The employee may have been a motivated contributor, but now withdraws and contributes little."
 Little or no interest in the future.
"Whether you are discussing a vision for the future or your office holiday party, this employee is clearly only interested in what’s “here and now.”

Contented Cows Give Better Milk
As Bill Catlette and Richard Hadden shared in their book, Contented Cows Give Better Milk (Saltillo Press, 1998), organizations that don’t measure up in the eyes of their employees tend to be viewed as an employer of last resort."
"Either the organization is forced to pay market-premium wages and salaries in an attempt to secure better applicants, or it must accept lower-quality applicants—or both."
"In their research on contented organizations, Catlette and Hadden compared the growth, revenue, and net job gain (generation of new jobs) of six Contented Organizations with that of six Common Organizations in similar industries."
"To make the Contented Cow list, organizations were required to meet the following minimum criteria:
 Profitability—a consistent track record of growth in revenue and earnings."
 Continuity—in business for at least five years.
" Desirability—generally regarded by the people who work within the organization as a good place to work, with positive employee relations practices."
"Their research showed that the Contented Organizations outgrew the Common Organizations by a four-to-one margin, outearned them by nearly $40 billion, and generated a net difference of better than 800,000 jobs."
"Catlette and Hadden also found that the Contented Organizations were remarkably similar in three areas:
 Aligning their people with their organization’s purpose and objectives."
 Caring about and recognizing people.
" Enabling people to perform by providing necessary training, information, and tools."
"In our Peter Barron Stark Companies research, we see it over and over: Successful organizations separate themselves from less-prosperous


organizations by providing employees with an understanding of the company’s mission and vision, setting clear expectations, helping people understand the significance of their contributions to the company, and giving them the opportunity to learn and grow."
"Our findings prove that the extent to which people do or do not fully contribute is governed more by attitude than by necessity, fear, or economic influence."
If you want to be an employer of choice—and a business success—it’s all in your organization’s attitude.
And that attitude can be best realized by following the 10 Keys to Workplace Excellence.
"The 10 Keys to Workplace Excellence




Amazing as it may sound, there are only 10 keys that distinguish Best-of-the-Best organizations."
Using them allows you entrance into the exclusive territory of employer of first choice.
"They are:
1."
"A Compelling, Positive Vision With Clear Goals."
2.
Communication—The Right Stuff at the Right Time.
3.
Select the Right People for the Right Job.
4.
Remember: We’re on the Same Team.
5.
Cool Stuff––Continuous Improvement and Innovation.
6.
Recognize and Reward Excellent Performance.
7.
Accountability Counts.
8.
Every Employee Learns and Grows.
9.
Problems…No Problem!
10.
It’s All About the Customer.
"These 10 keys give Best-of-the-Best organizations a distinct competitive advantage in the market: Because of their particular relationship with management and the organization, their employees


are willing to expend a discretionary effort."
"Basically, because the employees “get” more, they “give” more."
"It’s not unusual for an employee opinion survey to show an overall, company-wide favorable response of 78 percent."
"Yet surprisingly, there is often a variance of 30 to 50 percentage points between managers."
Each key is under the direct control of an employee’s immediate manager or supervisor.
That means you—and the people you coach— can change the way you lead to improve performance.
There are two ways to improve the results of an employee opinion survey.
"First, the manager can change and exhibit new leadership behaviors."
"Second, senior management can make a tough decision and change the manager of the area that has low results."
"Sometimes the leadership change improves the organization, but other times one leader leaving the organization can have a devastating impact on workplace excellence."
"As a leader, do not ever underestimate your role, power, and responsibility to create an environment where your employees love to come to work and your customers love to do business."
"You can make a meaningful difference to your direct reports and your organization, in spite of decisions made by senior management or even the board."
"The old cliché is supported by our research:
People join an organization for a job and leave because of a manager."
"If you are a manager who wants to make a significant contribution in your organization and in the lives of your employees, use the 10 keys to focus your leadership."
"These keys are the result of nearly 20 years of research, and they reflect our expertise in coaching managers to improve the environment for their employees."
"Key #1: A Compelling, Positive Vision With Clear Goals
There is no doubt that one of the great management buzzwords of our time is vision."
It is high on the list with other words such as stakeholders and paradigm.
"A clear mental image of a desired future outcome, a vision is like the picture on a jigsaw puzzle box that shows you exactly what you are trying to create."
"Call it a vision,


mission, purpose, philosophy, or values—the labels vary––but they usually describe the same thing: the overarching goal of an organization."
"Not surprisingly, Best-of-the-Best organizations do an especially better job communicating their vision of the future, listing company goals, and ensuring employees are clear on what goals and results they are accountable for achieving."
"Statement: “I am clear on my organization’s goals and future direction.”

Best-of-the-Best Benchmark:	89.5%
Overall Benchmark:	74.8%
Best-of-the-Best exceed by:	+14.7
Figure 1: Best-of-the-Best on Vision

Visions do work for the bottom line."
"Two Stanford professors, James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras, surveyed CEOs at Fortune 500 and Inc. 100 companies to identify organizations they thought were “visionary” and compared them with their competitors."
"Going back to 1926, they showed that, if you invested one imaginary dollar in a general mutual fund, by 1990, your dollar would have grown to $415."
"If you invested that same imaginary dollar with visionary companies, in 1990 your $1 would have grown to $6,356.1 Aren’t those the types of results you and your organization are seeking?"
"For more details, read Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies (Collins & Porras, 1994)."
"However, the problem with “vision” is threefold."
"First, some organizations do not have a clear vision of where they are heading."
"As one employee told us, “I love reading mysteries, but I do not enjoy working in the middle of one.”



Second, some organizations state a vision, but do not live the vision or bring it to a reality."
"At one organization, the executives passed out little cards printed with the new vision."
That was the last time the employees heard about it.
"Even worse, the actions of the managers at the company were the antithesis of what was in the vision."
"Employees are motivated by what they see on a daily basis in the halls, not what they read on the walls."
"Statement: “Our daily business practices are consistent with our mission statement.”

Best-of-the-Best Benchmark:	90.2%
Overall Benchmark:	79.7%
Best-of-the-Best exceed by:	+10.5
Figure 2: Best-of-the-Best on Consistent Business Practices
The third problem is not creating an organizational structure that supports the vision, and instead focuses on personalities."
"Although it generates lots of work for consultants, designing organizational charts around “who plays nice together or who doesn’t” is not in the organization’s best interest."
A structure that is most effective at assisting the organization to achieve its vision leads to superior results.
"Statement: “My company’s organizational structure supports our ability to accomplish our vision and goals.”

Best-of-the-Best Benchmark:	75.5%
Overall Benchmark:	62.2%

A vision can be an incredibly powerful tool for managers and supervisors."
"When Louis Gerstner, Jr. took charge of IBM in 1993, the company was in turmoil and the company’s annual net losses reached a record $8 billion."
"At the time, Gerstner was quoted as saying, “The last thing IBM needs is a vision.” Only a year later, in 1994, he conceded that


IBM did require some long-range thinking."
An incredible turnaround story began as a result of the vision that emerged from a strategic planning session.
"IBM’s senior management team articulated the focus of strength for the company and, in 1995, Gerstner communicated IBM’s new vision: Network computing would drive the next phase of industry growth and would be the company’s overarching strategy."
This vision and long-range strategy sent IBM on a series of acquisitions that positioned network services to become the fastest-growing segment of the company.
IBM’s extraordinary turnaround demonstrated that the most important thing the organization needed was a shared vision.
A clear vision and strategic goals are forces that encourage and energize people.
"A great vision is radical, compelling, and heartfelt."
Vision comes from the heart and creates passion in both people and organizations.
It’s a vision because you can see it.
"What Best-of-the-Best organizations do differently than others is ensure that they possess a compelling, positive vision, known by every employee, along with goals and the company’s future direction."
"When people are clear on the destination, and are given a map to get to the destination and a tour guide communicating along the way, they will not only support the expedition, but they will really enjoy the trip."
"If you want to increase motivation, raise morale, and promote even higher levels of productivity, define a compelling, positive vision."
"Key #2: Communication—The Right Stuff at the Right Time
Have you ever felt this way, or worked for someone who seemed to believe that employees don’t:
 Need corporate information to do their jobs?"
" “Get it,” so there’s no need to bother passing along pertinent information?"
 Care about strategic direction?
"Whether these are real reasons or excuses, when managers hold these beliefs and don’t communicate to employees, the relationship between managers, employees, and the organization almost always


deteriorates."
"When employees do not feel that their opinions and thoughts are welcomed or valued, they eventually stop making sugges- tions or decisions and just do what they are told."
That’s not the attitude that brings success.
"Real communication, whether in a personal relationship or an organization, is difficult to get right."
"People are busy and it is hard to find the time to communicate, but it can be done."
Best-of-the-Best organizations value two-way communication between management and employees instead of only the top-down directive communication that happens in many organizations.
Best-of-the-Best leaders make an effort to seek out the thoughts and opinions of employees.
They expect employees to think and make decisions that improve the company.
And they are in the habit of seeking the thoughts and opinions of employees prior to making changes that impact their work.
"Statement: “Managers and supervisors at my organization seek the opinions and thoughts of the employees who work here.”

Figure 4: Best-of-the-Best on Seeking Employee Opinions
An 18.2-percentage-point difference is a competitive weapon in the business of employee engagement."
"If more of your employees are fully engaged, knowing that their thoughts and opinions make a difference to their organization’s success, you are likely to have a more productive, profitable organization with higher levels of customer satisfaction compared with your competitors."
You’ve probably experienced a delay between the time senior management knows about something and the time the front line learns about the information.
"In some organizations, communication happens very quickly; in others, it could take months or even years."
Managers who are good communicators believe employees need to know the information to do their jobs.
"Of course, once one person in an organization knows the information, eventually his or her peers are
in the loop, and the information trickles down to everyone—even if the information is now inaccurate or embellished."
"You will find that there are very few things in organizations that are truly “confidential.”
Statement: “When good or bad things happen at my organization, employees hear about it in a timely manner.”

Figure 5: Best-of-the-Best on Sharing Information
The more that sensitive or “un-discussable” topics are kept from employees or lower layers of management, the more employees will feel that management does not trust them."
"As a result, employees will find it difficult to do their jobs."
"As part of an employee survey process, one manager stated he did not share information with his staff because “employees do not see the big picture.” However, each of his employees eventually did hear the information and then, one by one, went to the manager to ask if it was accurate."
Most companies have some type of regularly scheduled management team meeting.
"When the meeting is over, Best-of-the-Best managers are significantly better at making sure their employees know about the organization’s future plans."
"Statement: “My supervisor/manager keeps us informed about our organization’s plans.”

Figure 6: Best-of-the-Best on Sharing Company Plans


There are the plans and then there are changes to the plans."
"To be successful, organizations need to change course and adjust plans."
These changes also need to be communicated quickly.
Imagine your frustration and embarrassment if you were a manager whose opinion survey reflected this comment: “I am angry.
"I have been working on this project, which I learned just last week was cancelled 60 days ago.”
Statement: “When changes are made at my organization, I hear about it in a timely manner.”

Figure 7: Best-of-the-Best on Timely Communication
Senior management plays a significant role in the overall communication that flows down to employees."
"When the CEO or president regularly communicates with all employees, whether through e-mail, video, or a town-hall meeting, most employees appreciate the communication."
"The challenge for senior managers is that they will never be fully effective at getting the communication down to the front lines unless they are supported by managers and supervisors who place a high value on making sure employees are “in the loop.”
Statement: “Communication flows effectively from upper management to employees.”

Get the lag time out of your organization’s communication."
"The faster senior and middle managers, along with immediate supervisors, can get the communication down to the front lines, the better equipped employees will be to make the right decisions and provide extraordinary service."
"Key #3: Select the Right People for the Right Job
Sit back and think for a minute about how the people you manage feel about their colleagues."
Would they say that you hired excellent team members who were an asset to the organization?
"In the minds of their employees, Best-of-the-Best organizations are 20 percentage points higher than organizations in the Overall Benchmark."
"When your organization acquires a reputation for workplace excellence, you tend to attract a higher-caliber candidate to interview."
"If your organization has a reputation for hiring those people, you are not going to take on a mediocre or poor candidate."
"As Best-of-the-Best organizations do, you would rather wait and re-post the job than give the position to a candidate who is not a fit."
"Statement: “My organization hires the most qualified candidates possible.”

Figure 9: Best-of-the-Best on Hiring Qualified Candidates
In Best-of-the-Best organizations, multiple people interview the candidate."
"More people give input to determine if the candidate is a fit, both technically and as a team member."
Another feature that separates Best-of-the-Best organizations is that the hiring process and new employee orientation are a big deal.
These organizations know that they spend valuable time and money finding the right person for the job.
"They want to do everything they possibly can to ensure the employee’s, and the organization’s, success."
Result: Best-of-the-Best organizations are significantly better at carefully aligning the employee to the organization.
"Statement: “New people are carefully oriented to ‘the way we do things around here.’”

Figure 10: Best-of-the-Best on Orientation
Best-of-the-Best organizations are significantly different because they promote qualified, well-trained people into positions of manage- ment."
"If an individual supervisor or manager plays a leadership role in creating workplace excellence, then it makes sense that this leader is promoted into a leadership position."
"Statement: “My organization promotes qualified, well-trained employees to management.”

Figure 11: Best-of-the-Best on Promotion to Management
Selecting the right leader is critical to your organization’s success."
Whether an employee leaves your company at the end of the day saying “I love my job” or “I don’t get paid enough to put up with this crap” depends on the relationship the employee has with his or her immediate supervisor.
"Give an employee an excellent leader, and you radically increase your chance of being rated as a Best-of-the-Best organization."
"(Give an employee a great leader who, as you will read in Key #8, provides the employee with growth opportunities, and you have an even bigger chance of being an employer of choice.)"
"Key #4: Remember: We’re on the Same Team
When it comes to organizational success, individuals cannot win without a team."
Teams cannot win without the contributions of individual team members.
"Michael Jordan, the NBA legend, had it right when he stated that it was important for everyone to remember that “there is no ‘I’ in team, but there is an ‘I’ in win.” To consistently win, you need both great players and great teamwork."
"It is important that each team member take responsibility, be ac- countable, and produce extraordinary results so the team can win."
Best-of-the-Best organizations understand the fine balance between teamwork and individual contributions.
"Statement: “My organization places a high value on teamwork.”

Best-of-the-Best exceed by:	+11.3
Figure 12: Best-of-the-Best on Valuing Teamwork

Figure 13: Best-of-the-Best on Intradepartmental Teamwork
Almost everyone in both benchmarks agrees that teamwork is a strength within their own departments."
"What is particularly different about the Best-of-the-Best is that they are not only stronger at teamwork in their own departments, but cross-departmentally as well."
"Statement: “In my organization, the departments cooperate well together.”

Figure 15: Best-of-the-Best on Cross-Departmental Communication
Once you build teamwork in your own department, you can rise above the rest by extending that teamwork and communication to other departments."
"Teamwork—the actions, not just the talk—begins with you."
"Your leadership style is essential to executing that vision by communicating the essential information about your strategies and projects up, down, and across the organization."
"Key #5: Cool Stuff––Continuous Improvement and Innovation
Many times after working with a Best-of-the-Best client, we return to the office and share with our staff the “cool stuff”—creating new products, processes, or services; or solving significant organizational or industry problems—a client is working on."
"Anything other than performing the day-to-day components of the job can fall into the category of “cool stuff.”
For Betteravia Farms, one of the largest produce farms in California, innovation is a core component of its business practices."
"Fifteen years ago, Betteravia watered crops by flooding the rows."
Fertilizers were applied by driving a tractor through the fields.
"Through employee ideas and a continual goal of improving efficiency, new systems were developed."
"Today, all of the crops are watered and fertilized through pinholes in a drip tape buried 2 inches in the ground."
A GPS-guided tractor plants the seeds directly over the pinholes.
These innovations have saved the farm millions of dollars annually.
"What is important to emphasize is that “cool stuff” is all about innovation, continuous improvement, and change."
And change makes most people uncomfortable.
An interesting finding from the benchmarks was that Best-of-the- Best leaders do a better job of keeping their employees “uncomfortable.” Some people have told us in strong words that “uncomfortable” is the wrong feeling to stir up within an employee.
"But uncomfortable is exactly what people feel when they are expected to add value to the organization by working on “cool stuff.”
We know that organizations are able to achieve what they value, expect, and recognize."
Best-of-the-Best organizations do an especially better job of establishing an environment where employees are expected and encouraged to improve quality in the organization.
This is a very different environment from one where innovation relies on an employee suggestion box that’s checked once a month just in case someone ventures to drop in a comment.
"Statement: “I am encouraged to take the initiative to improve quality in my area.”

Figure 16: Best-of-the-Best on Encouraging Innovation
Encouragement is a good thing."
Best-of-the-Best organizations have learned that setting expectations regarding continuous improvement— like including the topic on annual performance reviews—is even better.
Organizations get what they expect and what they measure.
"Statement: “People at my organization are expected to come up with new innovative ideas.”

Figure 19: Best-of-the-Best on Continuous Improvement
Although we have no scientific proof, we believe the leaders in Best-of-the-Best organizations sleep better at night because they spend less time lying awake worrying about problems to fix or con- flicts to resolve."
"In Best-of-the-Best organizations, employees are clear that it is their job to fix the problem and that management will be receptive to their recommendations and recognize their innovative contributions."
"Being leaders in innovation, Best-of-the-Best companies are learn- ing organizations that continuously try to “outlearn” their competition by thinking, testing, and eventually implementing new and better ways to improve the organization."
Best-of-the-Best organizations make in- novation and problem solving—and the recognition of the individuals who do these activities—an important part of their culture.
"If your organization emulates the Best-of-the-Best in this category, you may be marketing the next Teflon, Post-it Notes, or even Viagra."
All of these products were ac- cidental inventions developed by people working for organi- zations that valued and recog- nized continuous improvement and innovation.
Key #6: Recognize and Reward Excellent Performance Does your organization value all employees?
"Perhaps the answer that goes through your mind is, “Yes, our people are our most important asset.” Now ask yourself: Does your organization reward employees who are mediocre or poor performers?"
"Does your organization distribute bonuses solely based on the number of years of service to
your organization?"
"If you want your organization to be included in the Best-of-the-Best Benchmark, you must answer the last two questions with an emphatic “NO.”
When every employee receives the same reward, or when rewards are not linked directly to performance and results, it is almost guaranteed to lead to lower morale."
Best-of-the-Best organizations demonstrate that they value the people in their companies who are the most successful at achieving positive results and living the organization’s vision and values.
"For service organizations, people are the only asset."
"Statement: “I feel my organization appropriately rewards the highest achievers.”

Figure 20: Best-of-the-Best on Performance Rewards
Best-of-the-Best organizations look for opportunities to tell oth- ers about an employee’s excellent performance."
Will some people be offended that they were not also publicly recognized?
"Yes, but Best- of-the-Best organizations feel that the benefit to the organization of


acknowledging outstanding individual or team performance is well worth the risk of upsetting someone who was not recognized."
"Statement: “When someone performs well in our organization, others are informed of the success.”

Figure 22B: Best-of-the-Best on Appreciating Employee Contributions
Feeling appreciated is intangible and hard to describe."
"When people do not believe their unique contributions are valued, they tend to feel that they are treated like a commodity."
"When you are a commodity, it does not matter who does your job, as long as it gets done."
"Best-of-the-Best organizations do the necessary things: appropri- ately reward the highest achievers and then tell the world about positive


performance."
The result is their employees feel that the unique “gifts” they bring to work each day are valued.
People who truly feel valued want to stay in the relationship.
"Key #7: Accountability Counts
Performance management is handled very differently in Best-of- the-Best organizations in three distinct areas: First, the Best-of-the- Best are better at clearly defining what is expected from employees."
"Second, they excel in the area of giving employees feedback regarding their performance."
"And third, the Best-of-the-Best are better at holding all members of the team accountable to performance standards."
Employees need to see the target they are trying to hit.
Best-of- the-Best organizations do a much better job at ensuring that job responsibilities are clearly defined for every employee.
Employees need and want to be clear about their organizational responsibilities.
"Statement: “Job responsibilities at my organization are clearly defined.”

Best-of-the-Best Benchmark:	85.1%

Best-of-the-Best exceed by:	+13.4
Figure 23: Best-of-the-Best on Clearly Defined Job Responsibilities
A related area where the Best-of-the-Best lead is in ensuring that employees know how performance will be measured."
"Many employees have a double whammy going against them: They are not clear on their job responsibilities, and the performance standards are unclear."
"This is the equivalent of blindfolding the employees and then directing them to spend their time playing the organizational version of “pin the tail on the donkey.” When you are blindfolded, it is just about impossible to hit the goal."
"Statement: “I have a good understanding of the performance standards/measurements at my organization.”

Figure 24: Best-of-the-Best on Performance Standards
Providing performance feedback to employees is the second area in this key where Best-of-the-Best organizations excel."
"To be useful, feedback must help people learn, grow, and improve."
Best-of-the- Best companies are better than average at determining performance measures and coaching staff on how to reach or exceed them.
"Statement: “My performance review provides me with feedback that helps me learn, grow, and improve my performance.”

Figure 25: Best-of-the-Best on Performance Reviews
When an employee’s review is completed on time, and it is thorough, accurate, and provides examples for growth and development, it tells the employee that the supervisor cares about the employee."
Another piece the Best-of-the-Best contribute to completing the performance management and accountability puzzle is in the area of ongoing feedback.
"“Timely” ongoing feedback doesn’t rely solely on a performance review, which may be conducted once, or perhaps twice, a year."
"If you only communicate once a year, how can you foster team- work, solve problems, encourage innovation, and reward performance?"
"Immediate, ongoing feedback keeps you in contact with your staff and opens the door to them."
"When there is a performance issue, you deal with it immediately."
"Statement: “My supervisor gives me good ongoing feedback regarding my performance.”

Best-of-the-Best exceed by:	+9.7
Figure 26: Best-of-the-Best on Timely Ongoing Feedback
Although some argue it may be difficult for employees to determine accountability throughout the organization, one area where most employees see a very clear picture of reality is with the level of accountability that exists in their own departments."
"By watching the daily behavior of the individuals on their team, employees know if other team members are held accountable to meet team goals."
"To rise to the level of Best-of-the-Best organizations, you need to be good at three things:
 Clearly defining job responsibilities and ensuring employees understand those job responsibilities."
" Providing ongoing, timely feedback that helps employees learn and grow."
 Holding people accountable to meeting those responsibilities.
"Key #8: Every Employee Learns and Grows
A manager once said to us, “I don’t like some of the questions on your survey because my employees do not want to grow."
"They want to come to work each day, put their heads down, and do their jobs.” This was the same manager who told us he did not want to provide training for his employees because they would just quit and take their new skills to another employer."
"If you can relate to this manager’s concern, there is a strong possibility your department scores would not match the Best-of-the- Best Benchmark."
The problem with maintaining a bunch of untrained employees in your department who do not want to learn and grow is that they are going to be working for you the rest of their careers.
"These employees have few options, and no Best-of-the-Best organization will want to hire them."
"Statement: “My organization places a high value on training and educating employees.”

Figure 28: Best-of-the-Best on Opportunity for Advancement
Best-of-the-Best organizations succeed at creating an environment where employees want to work for them in the future by providing useful training and learning opportunities."

Employees who work in Best-of-the-Best organizations get access to good training programs."
"This is a positive reflection on the work of all the trainers and human resources professionals who struggle for


proof that training makes a difference."
But organizational develop- ment professionals cannot rest on their laurels just because there is a good program.
The training has to be relevant to both the employees’ and the organization’s success.
"Statement: “The training I receive is useful and helps me to do a better job.”

Figure 30: Best-of-the-Best on Training Effectiveness
People who feel well-trained to do the job they currently do and are confident that the organization will provide them with future opportunity, will most likely want to stay with their current organization."
"So we must ask: As a manager, are you encouraging staff to take advantage of these opportunities?"
"When you do a better job selecting the right people, and then do a better job training those people, you are going to give your organization a significant competitive advantage in your industry."
Key #9: Problems…No Problem!
"Although 73 percent of the employees in the Overall Benchmark believe their organizations want them to solve problems, only 60 percent say they are recognized for innovative ideas, which is a 13-percentage- point difference."
The organizations in the Best-of-the-Best Benchmark do a particularly better job at both recognizing employees and ensuring them that management wants them to solve problems.
"Statement: “Employees at my organization believe management wants them to solve problems.”

Figure 31: Best-of-the-Best on Problem-Solving


The Best-of-the-Best are also better than organizations in the Overall Benchmark in quickly resolving conflict in their organizations."
"Conflict causes people to be sidetracked by peripheral issues rather than staying focused on achieving the mission, vision, and goals of the organization."
"Statement: “When conflict arises in my organization, it is resolved in a timely manner.”

One could make a case that the problems employees encounter may not be performance-related."
"The challenge with this is that people make, and fix, problems."
"When problems are not fixed in a timely manner, they are allowed to linger."
It has been our experience that most people are able to identify problems quickly.
"What makes Best-of-the-Best organi- zations so different is that they not only identify the problem quickly, but they do a considerably better job resolving the problem."
"Statement: “At my organization, problems are identified and handled in the early stages.”

Key #10: It’s All About the Customer
One thing that is easy to agree on is that terrific customer service is really hard to find."
"In the extended studies program at San Diego State University, we’ve given hundreds of students the following assignment: Over the next two weeks, become a mystery shopper at 10 businesses you fre- quent."
"Rate the level of service you are provided as Great, Good, Fair,


or Poor."
"The results are always the same: The average percentage of businesses with a service level rated as “Great” is approximately 20
percent."
Almost all employees say their organizations place a high value on customer service.
What is important is that 94 percent of the people working for the Best-of-the-Best say their organizations place a high value on exceeding customer expectations.
"Statement: “My organization places a high value on exceeding customer expectations.”

Best-of-the-Best Benchmark:	93.7%

Best-of-the-Best exceed by:	+10.4
Figure 34: Best-of-the-Best on Valuing Customer Service
Although employees in both benchmarks say their organizations place a high value on customer service, the Best-of-the-Best are notably better at providing the managerial support employees require to accomplish that goal."

Figure 35: Best-of-the-Best on Taking Initiative in Customer Service
The Best-of-the-Best understand that everyone in the organization either directly serves the customer or directly supports someone who serves the customer."
"With management’s strong willingness to serve employees, it is easier to create an environment in which customers love to do business with an organization."
"Have you ever received poor customer service because of a stupid policy, procedure, or system?"
"If you are a resident of San Diego who wants to reserve a city park for a Boy Scout or Girl Scout event, you have to drive to downtown San Diego, through a lot of traffic and with few options for parking, to hand in an application in person."
"You cannot do it by mail, Federal Express, or e-mail."
"If you live outside of San Diego County, though, you can simply mail in the application."
Why the difference?
The employees at the city parks department don’t know.
"They only know the rule.2
This is an excellent example of designing a policy, procedure, and system that ensures customers will complain."
This type of policy most likely would not be adopted by an organization in the Best-of-the-Best Benchmark.
"Statement: “My organization’s policies, procedures, and systems support me in providing quality customer service.”

Figure 36: Best-of-the-Best on Customer Service Systems
Best-of-the-Best organizations understand that, to have customers experience your company, thank you for the great service, and become loyal advocates who are five times more likely to refer your business to other customers, you need the right policies, procedures, systems, and environment in place."
You’ll also see that Best-of-the-Best organizations are significantly bet- ter at ensuring their employees have the right support to get the job done.
"Statement: “I have the tools and equipment I need to do a good job.”

Figure 38: Best-of-the-Best on Creating an Environment Conducive to Customer Service
It is not a surprise that more than 80 percent of employees in the Overall Benchmark agreed that their organizations place a high value on customer service."
"Compared to the average competitor in the marketplace, companies that care enough to conduct an employee opinion survey are probably really good at providing service to their customers."
"Besides, it is hard to stay in business long without a monopoly if your customers are continuously not satisfied."
It is the additional 10-percentage-point difference in providing the support for that service that gives Best-of-the-Best companies an appreciably competitive advantage.
Supporting their employees allows them to provide customers with the quality service they desire.
"A foundation of strong communication and support ensures that the right policies, procedures, systems, tools, and equipment are in place."
The resulting environment allows employees to provide a level of exceptional service.
Why wouldn’t customers love to do business with Best-of-the-Best organizations?
Something Is Missing—Show Me the Money!
"When we talk about these 10 keys with clients, invariably someone asks, “Where’s the money?"
Isn’t wage or salary one of the key differentiators between Best-of-the-Best organizations and the rest of the pack?” The answer is a little bit of yes and a lot of no.
"There is only a 5.9-percentage-point difference between Best-of- the-Best companies (67.9 percent) and Overall Benchmark companies


(62.0 percent) when employees responded to the statement “Compared to a similar position in my industry and geographic location, I am fairly compensated.”
A variance of 6 percentage points is not significant, particularly when you look at the employees’ responses to statements reported in “The 10 Keys to Workplace Excellence” section."
Did you expect a bigger monetary difference between Best-of-the- Best organizations and the Overall Benchmarks?
"Not only is there not much difference, but during the last three years, the gap between the two has continued to shrink."
"The reason is simple: To hire and retain an employee, both the overall organizations and Best-of-the-Best organizations need to pay a competitive wage."
Most employees would not join a new company to take home a lower wage than they currently earn.
All companies must be competitive unless they are seeking unemployed candidates who are willing to take any job at any wage.
"Whenever an employee leaves a company, most often the manager will say, “The employee left for a ton of money and there is no way we could counter the amount and get the employee to stay.” As stated in the previous chapter, the average amount of wage increase employees receive upon leaving your organization is only approximately 6 percent, and the reason they leave is because they do not love their jobs or feel a strong relationship with their bosses."
"When they love their jobs and have a strong effective working relationship with their managers, it takes significantly more than 6 percent to get people to jump ship."
Money is used as the excuse to leave for two reasons.
"First, employees are not really excited about telling the people who will be providing them with an employment reference that they were a bad or mediocre manager."
"Second, if managers can blame the exit on money, they do not have to accept any responsibility for the employee leaving."
"Hence, there is nothing the manager can do about losing good people until someone in power fixes the salaries."
"Begin to Make a Difference
You can do what the best organizations do: Use the 10 Keys to Workplace Excellence."
"Start with a compelling, positive vision that can be reached by defining clear and concrete goals."
"Add in an ongoing at- titude that more communication to employees is better, and hire and train the people who are receptive to communication and achieving the company vision."
"Foster teamwork, both within your own department and with other departments."
"Move forward with large quantities of encouragement to improve the product, service, and the organization."
Hold people accountable and continually recognize excellent performance.
"Offer the training and op- portunities people need to perform well, and make sure they have the re- sources to provide customer service that generates customer satisfaction."
The most important aspect to remember is that it’s up to the indi- vidual to utilize his or her leadership skills to use the keys.
"Part 2
If YOU’RE a MANAGER WHO WANTS to BE a LEADER, YOU NEED
FOLLOWERS






Being the Leader Who Makes a Difference




It’s easy to get fired up about the most recent managerial “buzz.” We’ve lived through Quality Circles, TQM, Management by Walking Around, shifting paradigms, scorecards, dashboards, Hedgehogs, Black Belt, Lean Manufacturing, the right habits, different hats, and many others."
All of these management principles offer something useful.
"Still, it’s not necessary to jump on the newest trend to be a great leader."
"In our years of interacting with hundreds of organizations and thousands of managers, we have seen a similarity between the things managers do that get them into trouble and the things leaders do that earn faithful followers."
"Those insights, based on the benchmark results and what we’ve learned in our work with leaders in organizations, are profound, yet relatively easy to understand."
"More importantly, they flow from what we’ve learned from working with employees in these same organizations."
"As you read through this list, you may be tempted to say, “This isn’t rocket science.” We would agree with you."
"If it’s so simple and straightforward, though, why don’t more managers practice the 10 Keys to Workplace Excellence to improve their leadership ability and develop a great working environment?"
"Excuses Stink
While reviewing the results of an employee opinion survey, many CEOs or senior management team members have asked, “When so


many people who work here are really happy, how can employees in three low-rated departments be so unhappy?"
"When you look at the data, it looks like people are working for a totally different organization."
"How can this be?”
The answer is this: The difference in how employees feel about the organization is in direct correlation to the quality of their leaders."
Culture in organizations is not easy to change.
Both managers and employees become accustomed to the organization’s environment and can take a “that’s the way we are here” attitude.
Some of the low- performing managers we have interviewed shared reasons for their low scores.
"The reasons include:
 That is the way the board, CEO, or senior management team is, and things will never change."
" We do not pay people enough, and I get no support from HR or senior management to give them a raise."
" HR will not support managers, so performance problems will never be addressed."
 Too many people in the organization are protected like sacred cows.
" People in the organization don’t understand what our department is “all about.”
 The industry, or this position, has high turnover."
 The employees don’t have a firm grasp on reality.
 The employees will never be happy.
" The low scores are a reflection of another manager or supervisor, not me."
" I will never create an organization that is “touchy-feely.”
 The employees did not understand the questions when taking the survey."
"Whether managers believe they can positively influence the work environment for the employees in their areas, or believe they cannot, it is important to note: THEY ARE RIGHT!"
"If managers believe they can create workplace excellence, they likely utilize the 76 strategies you’ll learn about in Chapter 6."
"If man-
agers believe there is not much they can do, they tend not to take action,
confirming their negative beliefs."
"Our
research solidly confirms this, regard- less of what anyone in the organiza- tion thinks."
One manager can make the differ- ence.
"If you want to change the work environment, change the way you manage."
"Develop a Positive, Compelling Vision of the Future
We challenge each leader to consider his or her personal, individual vision and how it impacts the organization."
“Vision” is not another fad.
"It is the first step here, and the first of the 10 Keys to Workplace Excellence, for a reason."
A compelling vision and clearly articulated goals are the foundation of Best-of-the-Best or- ganizations.
Every leader has a type of a vision.
Which of the following matches your outlook?
"The first vision type is positive and uplifting: “Today is a great day, and tomorrow is going to be even better.” Leaders with positive visions take the necessary actions to make the department even more produc- tive and the environment an even better place to do the work."
"The second vision type is what we call status quo: “Today is okay, and I’m hoping that tomorrow will be all right, too.” These managers are trying to hang on to their current situation."
The ultimate goal of a manager with a status quo vision is to keep things from getting worse.
"The third vision type is negative: “If you think today is bad, just wait until tomorrow."
It’s going to get worse!” These managers usually choose to take no action—and things do get worse.
Only a positive vision can inspire.
"Leaders with a clear idea of what they stand for and where they are heading, and who have communicated their expectations to employees, are both inspiring and easy to follow."
"Their employees maintain an understanding of the leader’s values and


can predict how the leader will react in a given situation."
It is impossible to keep levels of morale and productivity high if the leader is not a role model for a “can do” positive attitude.
One of the greatest visionaries in history was a man whose first seven businesses failed.
"Twice bankrupt, on two occasions he spent time in a mental institution."
"Fired by a newspaper editor for a lack of creativity, he had trouble finding financing to begin constructing his most famous idea."
His name was Walt Disney.
"In 1955, he opened Disneyland in Anaheim, California, even though there were many critics who felt the park would fail."
"Nine years later, he began to buy rights to land in Orlando, Florida, to build a second theme park."
"Unfortunately, Walt Disney did not live long enough to see Orlando’s Disney World become a reality."
"On a behind-the-scenes tour at Disney World, I (Peter) asked the tour guide, a young college student, “Wouldn’t it have been great if Walt Disney could have seen Disney World when construction was complete?” The young student replied, “Sir, here at Disney World, we really do believe that Walt did see the completion.”
How true."
"Walt Disney saw the completion before anyone did, and spent his entire life trying to share the vision with others."
"You can do the same by involving others in creating, clarifying, and crystallizing your organization’s vision."
"Clarify Great Performance for Every Employee
There is nothing motivating about accomplishing a mediocre goal."
"When you isolate the leaders of the highest-rated departments and com- pare them with those in the lowest-rated departments, the most signifi- cant difference is in the area of managing an employee’s performance."
"When employees were asked if their manager set and communicated performance objectives for each employee, the highest-rated leaders achieved a result that was 32 percentage points more favorable than the lowest-rated managers."
"Recognize Both Great and Poor Performance
The next significant difference between managers in the high- and low-performing departments is recognition."
"When employees responded to the statement “My manager provides me with adequate recognition


for positive performance,” the highest-rated departments once again achieved results that were approximately 28 percentage points more fa- vorable than the lowest-rated departments."
"Great leaders ensure that, when an employee does a good job, he or she is recognized."
"By interviewing managers who lead the highest- and lowest-rated departments, we have learned that the managers of the highest-rated departments do things differently."
"First, they provide recognition immediately after they learn about an employee’s positive performance."
"The longer you wait to do this, the less meaning the recognition will have."
"If you wait too long, the recognition will actually become a de-motivator for some employees."
"Second, the highest-rated managers tend to tailor their recognition to best meet the needs of the employee."
"For some employees, recognition is most effectively provided one-on-one."
"For others, recognition may be an e-mail sent to the team or a note written in a newsletter."
"And for still others, it may be recognition presented in a team meeting."
"Third, highly rated leaders encourage other managers and employees on their teams to recognize colleagues who do a great job."
"This way, rec- ognition becomes part of the team’s culture and is not dependent solely on the manager."
"An observation by Barbara Walters is worth remembering: “To feel valued, to know, even if only once in a while, that you can do a job well is an absolutely marvelous feeling.”
Performance problems are also recognized, but differently."
"Just as managers in the highest-rated departments recognize great performance, they are also notably better when it comes to recognizing performance that is not on target."
"When employees were asked to rate the statement “My manager identifies and handles performance problems in the early stages,” the managers in the highest-rated departments received a response that was approximately 40 percentage points more favorable than the lowest-rated managers."
"Leaders in the highest-rated departments do not manage perfor- mance problems with hope, hint, or prayer."
These high-performing managers get involved with the poor performers to produce a mean- ingful outcome: Either the poor-performing employee corrects the problem or leaves the organization.
"This action, in the minds of other employees in the department, is crucial."
The managers in the highest-rated departments were approximately 24 percentage points better at providing ongoing feedback regarding an employee’s performance.
What excuses do low-rated managers provide?
"They are too busy putting out fires set by customers and employees, and just “don’t have the time” to recognize great performance and quickly address performance problems."
"Effective leaders know that providing recognition for meeting and exceeding high performance goals
and effectively fixing performance problems is an important part of their jobs."
"Over-Communicate Because You Really Care
As you saw in the 10 Keys to Workplace Excellence, communication is important if you want to be in the Best-of-the-Best Benchmark."
"But, once again, when we compare managers in the highest-rated departments with managers in the lowest-rated departments, there are noticeable differences."
The managers in the highest-rated departments figure out how to get information regarding the organization to their employees.
"When comparing the highest-rated managers with the lowest-rated managers, there is an impressive 30-percentage-point difference."
"They specifically relay how the organization’s plans will impact the employees, their jobs, and the department."
Managers leading high-rated departments know that going out of their way to communicate with employees indirectly tells the employees that they really care about them.
"In today’s technological world, it is not hard to be accessible or connected to your employees, but for some reason, the managers in the lowest-rated departments struggle with accessibility."
"On the survey, employees were asked to respond to this statement: “My manager is easily accessible when needed (for example, in person or by phone, e-mail, and voice mail).” The highest-rated department leaders earned a response that was more favorable by 26 percentage points."
"The benchmark tells us that, when a manager listens to an employ- ee’s opinion and acts on the input, the employee feels valued."
"In fact, managers in the highest-rated departments were rated approximately


23 points more favorably by employees in response to “My manager solicits my opinion regarding work affecting my areas of responsibil- ity.” The managers in the highest-rated departments understand the importance of involving employees and asking for their opinions on anything that is related to their jobs."
Admit It!
"You Made a Mistake
Sure, this sounds easy enough to do."
"However, in our experience, only about half of the managerial population is comfortable admitting an error."
"The other half makes excuses, usually claiming that something outside of their control explains their actions."
Only leaders who feel confident in their ability to lead also feel comfortable admitting when they make a mistake.
"When employees were asked to rate the statement “My manager is able to admit when he makes a mistake,” the managers of the highest-rated departments demonstrated a favorable response that was 26 percentage points higher than the lowest-rated managers."
"Just say, “I messed up."
I am sorry.
"And I am grateful I have the team I do so we can get this problem corrected.” Most times, when you can say “I made a mistake,” people will go out of their way to forgive you and correct the situation."
"Outwork Everyone Else
We are not referring to the number of hours that you put into your job."
What we mean is the amount of value you bring to your team or organization.
"“Outworking” others means you add value by: bringing a compelling, positive vision, solving quality or service problems that no one else has solved, dealing with difficult employees or customers, and/ or creating an environment where employees love coming to work."
"The benchmark data reveal another point: The managers of the highest-rated departments exhibit stronger work habits, which their employees recognize."
"Managers of the highest-rated departments had a more favorable––by 32 percentage points––response to the statement “My manager sets a good example with his/her work habits.”
If your employees do not feel you set a good example with your work habits, lower morale will become prevalent and it will become difficult to ask for, and manage, excellent performance."
"Trust Your Employees
People do not follow those they do not trust."
Trust builds a relation- ship where employees feel confident about following your lead.
"When the goals are clear, top-performing managers trust that their employees will get the job done."
"In response to the benchmark statement “I trust my manager,” the top-performing managers were rated 30 percentage points more favorably than managers of the lowest-rated departments."
"Managers whose departments rated them so significant-
ly higher know the importance of strong trust."
Best-of-the-Best organizations can teach us six important lessons about building trust between the management team and employees.
"Trust-Building #1: Clarify, Crystallize, and Communicate Your Organization’s Core Values
What do the leaders in your organization say they value?"
"Leaders we work with cite values such as ethical decision-making; open, honest, clear, and direct communication; teamwork; results; top-performing employees; satisfied customers; innovation; and work-life balance."
What is important is that the leaders can clearly articulate to every employee the values that drive decisions and day-to-day business practices in their organization.
"Trust-Building #2: Be Consistent
If leaders are clear about the vision and core values, it becomes easier to make consistent decisions."
"In these companies, an extremely high value is placed on ethical decision-making, results, and customer satisfaction."
"After a recent keynote speech on employee engagement and work- place excellence, a CEO came up to me (Jane) and said, “I have a vice president that needs to leave our organization."
"I would like to hire you as a coach so that when I let him go, the VP will know that I did everything possible to try to make the relationship work.” For me, it was an easy decision to say, “I don’t think that I would make a good coaching fit for your organization.” The honest, ethical, and caring thing for this CEO to do in this situation would be to call in the VP and let him go."
"We value satisfied customers, but we value ethical business practices even more."
"In another situation, one of our clients fired a high-performing manager who refused to treat her employees with dignity and respect."
"When we asked the CEO about making this difficult decision, she replied, “Because of our strong values, this decision was really easy."
"The only thing that was difficult was the actual meeting where I let the manager go.”
Trust-Building #3: Keep Your Word
Trust is built by doing what you say you are going to do, when you say you are going to do it, even if you no longer feel like doing it."
A big challenge for managers is that employee trust recalibrates itself daily in response to leadership decisions and behaviors.
"Best-of-the-Best organizations are appreciably better at doing what they say they are going to do, when they say they are going to do it."
"In regard to following through and keeping commitments, the Best-of-the-Best Benchmark exceeded the Overall Benchmark by 16.2 percentage points."
"Trust-Building #4: Ensure That Communication Is Open and Honest
Communication from managers regarding the vision, values, and strategic goals is essential to building trust."
Honest and direct com- munication regarding performance also builds trusting relationships.
"When employees were asked if their company was open and honest with employees, the Best-of-the-Best Benchmark exceeded the Overall Benchmark by 15.1 percentage points."
"Trust-Building #5: Involve Employees in Decisions That Impact Their Work
This seems like common sense, because the people who best know how to improve their work are the people doing that work."
"But from time to time, we work with managers who say, “These people are so out of touch with reality, they do not even know what changes need to take place to make our organization even more successful.”
If your goal is to work with an engaged, motivated workforce, you will benefit by involving employees in the decisions that impact their work."
"If the employees are truly not qualified to do the work, then coach, coun- sel, and train."
"If all that does not work, share them with a competitor."
"Trust-Building Lesson #6: Trust Employees
The fastest way for a leader to build trust with an employee is to place trust in the employee."
So go ahead and empower employees to make decisions and increase their responsibilities.
"Most employees, when given the power to make a decision or take on additional respon- sibility, will go out of their way not to undermine or erode the trust the leader has placed in them."
"When employees know they are trusted, they find it much easier to trust management."
Respect and trust have a lot in common.
"You probably have heard a manager say, “You will have to trust me on this.” There is a problem with this line."
You can’t demand or buy either trust or respect.
"The managers of the highest-rated departments know that when you give employees a clear goal and then provide frequent, positive, ongoing two-way communication, employees tend to feel respected."
"When employees said, “My manager respects me,” the managers of the highest-rated departments earned a favorable response that was 22 percentage points higher compared to the managers of the lowest-rated departments."
The managers who lead the highest-rated departments know that it is hard to be a great leader who gives respect without being respected.
"The Outcomes Are Priceless
After reviewing the comparisons between the approaches of the highest-rated and the lowest-rated managers, you can see why some employees were so happy and others were not."
The outcomes of an environment of workplace excellence are priceless.
"Employees in the highest-rated departments have a better relationship with their manag- ers, have a higher level of trust, and realize that they are respected."
"Because you spend approximately 95,000 hours of your life at work, it makes sense that it is easier to love your job when you enjoy a quality working relationship with your boss."
"When employees responded to the statement “I have a good working relationship with my manager,” the highest-rated department managers were 35 percentage points higher than the lowest-rated managers."
"Leadership Makes the Difference
Can it be that simple?"
Yes.
Great leaders know employees have choices about where they work.
"By using what you’ve learned in this


chapter, you can create an environment where people love to come to work and customers love to do business."
"It may not be rocket science, but it sure works."
This chart shows the percentage point difference between the highest-rated managers and the lowest-rated managers.
You can see how one leader can make a difference and how individual leaders can affect the ratings of the entire company.

"11 Stupid Things Managers Do to Mess Up Workplace Excellence



During an interview, Pam Smith, deputy director of Health and Human Services for San Diego County, summed up the importance of the manager/employee relationship when she stated, “Great employees deserve great leadership.”
Companies do not put the 10 Keys to Workplace Excellence into action—individual managers do."
The enormous amount of data we have collected—analyzing employee opinion survey data by divisions and departments—backs this up.
One manager in the organization can wield tremendous influence over how employees feel about their work experience.
"It doesn’t matter if there are five, 50, 500, or 5,000 employees—if the manager exerts positive leadership, employees will feel positive about their work experience."
The same is true if the manager is negative or apathetic about the work experience.
A company may achieve an overall employee opinion survey score that is 81-percent favorable.
"In that same company, one department’s score may be 92 percent, and another department’s or division’s score may be 44 percent."
How can this be?
"Isn’t it the same organization with the same vision, values, goals, and strategic initiatives?"
The massive swings in employee opinions occur because different managers form different environments inside the same organization.
"A major contributor to employees’ satisfaction, estimated in some surveys to be as much as 70 percent, is the relationship they experience with their immediate supervisor or manager."
"Though we could cite extensive research, let it suffice to simply say that organizations attracting, retaining, and motivating the best employees do so by paying a fair market wage and forming an environment where employees love to come to work."
"Obviously the money is a necessity, but the money alone will not guarantee that people will contribute with their fullest potential."
"Great organizations know that it is the
right relationships at work that attract the best employees and keeps them performing at peak effectiveness."
"Great Employees Deserve Great Managers
We believe that, when employees leave your organization, there is a strong possibility they are leaving because of poor leadership."
Any manager who has worked in human resources (HR) for longer than a year has heard similar stories over and over again in exit interviews.
"Based on these exit interviews, HR professionals acquire a pretty strong gut-level feeling for which managers in the organization build relationships where people willingly follow, and which managers in the organization are responsible for employees who are more than willing to share their talents with competitors."
It is important to note that not all employees who leave an organization are examples of “bad” turnover.
We strongly believe in the concept of “good” turnover.
There are poor-performing employees who are not happy with anyone or anything associated with the organization.
"Or, these employees do their jobs, but stir up an environment where everyone else suffers."
They brighten up the whole company when they depart.
“Bad” turnover occurs when employees who are outstanding contributors to the company’s success willingly leave the organization for equal or even less opportunity with another organization—just to escape their boss or intolerable working conditions.
"When great


employees leave, it is hard to replace the talent."
It also costs a ton of money to train the new employee to be a worthwhile contributor.
"In many of these situations (although it is hard to admit when it is your department or company), the best employees leave because of poor leadership."
"Yet, one leader makes a difference."
"In Chapter 3, we shared the actions that separate the highest- from the lowest-ranked leaders on employee opinion surveys."
"Although these steps are simple, many managers experience difficulty following them on a consistent basis."
"After years of working with organizations and coaching managers, we have identified the eleven stupid things managers do to mess up their organizations, departments, and teams."
"Most managers could pick out one, or even a few, of the stupid behaviors and say, “Wow, I have done that before.” The difference between most managers and the managers who disengage employees and destroy workplace excellence comes down to one word: frequency."
"Although all managers who are honest admit they have occasionally slipped and done something stupid in their careers, managers who incite havoc in the workplace put at least one of these stupid things into play with a high level of frequency."
"Worse yet, many of these managers know they are causing conflict, but for whatever reason, don’t stop doing it."
"In some cases, once their negative behavior is pointed out to them, they even escalate instances of their poor performance—just because they can."
"Stupid Behavior #1: Inability to Control Emotions
When utilized appropriately, emotions are a wonderful human attribute."
"When used improperly by managers, emotions can devastate organizations and their employees."
Number one on our list of stupid behaviors is the inability to control emotions.
"The worst offenders are managers labeled as “moody.”
Recently, with the hope of giving a manager feedback that would enable her to be even more effective, we conducted interviews with 15 of her employees and peers."
All respondents stated that the person’s primary opportunity for improvement was to display emotions that were consistent and appropriate to the situation.
"Examples respondents


shared regarding inappropriate leadership behaviors included: raising her voice when she was angry, whether in meetings or in one-on-one communications; sending e-mails that were accusatory in content; and using foul language when she was mad."
"Respondents stated you were either on her “good” list, or you were “off” her list and she ignored you."
One employee shared that one time she missed a deadline on a report.
"When she apologized to this manager for the deadline slipping through the cracks, the manager replied in anger, “Sorry is not good enough."
"I will never accept an apology for your incompetence.”
Finally, if this wasn’t enough negative feedback to win someone the label of “moody,” respondents went on to add that when this manager came into work each morning, she did not greet or speak to anyone."
It was well known around the office that she was not a “morning” person.
"During the interview process, we were really grateful to one respondent who said, “I hope that you are not planning to give her this feedback until late in the afternoon."
She is never good about accepting feedback.
"But in the morning, she is downright nasty!”
When you interview managers who have reputations for being moody or angry, they almost all describe their inappropriate behaviors as “honest or passionate communication.” As one manager recently told us, “I am a really honest person."
"I tell people what I think, right at the moment I think it, and some people cannot handle honest communication.” This excuse allows the manager to absolve herself of any responsibility for her employee not accepting how she communicates––the problem is with the employee, not the manager."
"The reality of the impact of this type of stupid behavior is that words, once spoken or written, are permanent."
"The challenge in the pervious example is that this manager’s communication was perceived as angry, inappropriate, and mean-spirited."
"Yet, if you asked this manager if her goal was to hurt people or undermine employees’ levels of commitment and motivation to do a great job, the manager would respond with a resounding, “No, of course not.”
It is interesting to note that most of the managers we work with who have been described as angry or moody are well aware that these emotions are affecting their personal and professional lives."
"Someone


with a ton of guts has told these managers that their responses to situations are wrong and undermine morale."
"However, the managers continue to use these behaviors in the workplace."
"The challenge with being labeled as moody, as angry, or as displaying emotions that do not fit the situation, is that people are unsure of how to approach the person for fear of how he will respond."
"People walk around the halls asking each other, “How is he today?” Or, “Is today a good day?”
Being considered a moody or emotional person is one of the toughest labels to shed and change in the minds of employees and peers."
"Stupid Behavior #2: Making Impulsive Decisions
Some emotional managers tend to be reactive and are known for making impulsive decisions."
These managers accumulate a track record for making quick decisions that undermine the organization’s success.
"Managers who are guilty of shooting without first taking aim are fond of screaming, “Fire, fire, fire!” Once they sound the alarm, they stand back to watch the troops rally to put out the blaze."
We recently worked with an impulsive vice president (VP) of facilities who had a strong dislike for the smell of burned popcorn.
"Being a decisive leader, she banned microwave popcorn throughout the facility."
"Despite her policy, twice in the previous month she had detected the offending odor."
"Wanting to solve this major crisis, this VP dedicated the efforts of her entire facilities team to researching, purchasing, and installing video surveillance cameras in the break rooms."
Her efforts didn’t stop there.
She then assigned team members on a rotating basis to review the surveillance tapes.
"Last we heard, the popcorn burner had not been identified, but the search continues."
"Typically, after the fire has been put out, the workforce resumes working on its organizational priorities."
"People feel good about their accomplishments, but it doesn’t take long for the impulsive manager to stumble upon another crisis and once again sound the alarm."
"With a unanimous “not again,” the entire team drops what it was doing and rallies to put out yet another fire."
Enlightened team members view the “crisis of the day” as being both preventable and a major disruption to their work and overall organizational objectives.
We worked at a company where the CEO had a personal dislike for the head of an important project that impacted the entire organization.
"Being known for his impulsive decisions, the CEO determined that this person should be fired that day."
"When we asked the CEO what his plan was when the project manager was fired, he looked at us and said, “I don’t have a plan.” Then he asked, “Do you know where we could find someone who is qualified?”
These emotional and impulsive managers share a common characteristic."
"Although they are known for their decisiveness, they are also known for their self-centered, crisis-management leadership style."
"They seldom consider overall organizational or departmental priorities, and they hold little regard for the importance of someone else’s work."
"Stupid Behavior #3: Blaming Others
Number three on our list of behaviors that get managers into big trouble is not taking initiative to proactively solve problems and produce results that lead to the organization’s success."
"These managers are famous for blaming their lack of results on other departments, their direct reports, their bosses, and even customers."
"There is an exception to this rule: When things go right, these managers are almost always the first to accept the credit and praise."
"These managers are famous for focusing all their energy on answering two questions: “What is wrong?” and “Who is to blame?” The managers who reach a whole new level address a third question: “Who do I psychologically whack or punish?”
Psychological whacks occur when a manager talks about what is wrong with a person, another department, or a situation."
The talking always occurs behind their backs; these managers never have the guts to address the issue directly with the individual.
"We served as executive coaches to two high-level, highly compensated managers who
refused to cooperate with one other, spoke negatively about their rival’s department with their own team members, consistently gossiped


about the other, and pointed fingers at each other for their difficulties."
"In fact, sometimes it seemed that each manager was spending a full day strategically plotting the demise of the other."
"Ultimately, despite coaching and a fair amount of warning, both individuals lost their jobs due to their inability to look for solutions to their conflict."
"After years of working with executives who have difficulty maintaining effective workplace relationships while blaming others for their inadequacies, we most often found that, if we dug deep into their methods of operation, we discovered that they lacked confidence in their ability to get the job done."
"When you lack confidence in your ability to influence your environment and take the necessary actions to produce positive results, one way to compensate is to look for others to blame for your own inadequacies."
"Stupid Behavior #4: Thinking, “It’s All About Me!”
These are the managers who sound like they are warming up for an opera as they sing praises of “me, me, me,” “my, my, my,” and “I, I, I.” These managers love to tell you about their amazing prior accomplishments and how the organizations they worked for in the past were so wonderful."
"By relating their great achievements, they indirectly put people, and their current organization, down in order to build themselves up."
The way things were done in the past is often an opportunity for them to speak derogatorily about everyone else.
We interviewed a manager who was adamant that not one person in the company had the knowledge or skills to accomplish the company’s goals.
"We were stunned by this comment and asked the manager to be sure we understood him correctly, “Not one person has either the knowledge or skills?” This manager boldly responded, “No, I am the only one in the organization with the big picture.”
It is one thing to lead change and take an organization to an even higher level."
"The highest-ranked leaders in the Benchmarks define a clear, compelling vision, clarify performance expectations, and then communicate these goals to staff."
"It is another thing, however, to attempt to motivate people to change by telling them how badly they handled things in the past."
That approach does nothing but cause animosity and resentment toward the manager.
"In an interview to collect feedback on a manager, one employee pointed out: “We have been successful enough to hire this new manager and move him and his family all the way across the country."
"To have him join our organization and, in the first month, listen to him tell everyone how bad we are and how good he is just turns people off."
"You are here as consultants because this manager was hit by friendly fire.”
Managers who take all the credit for the department’s, division’s, or organization’s success show a second form of “it’s all about me.” In taking all the credit, they find it difficult to praise, recognize, or give credit to the people who actually did the work that led to the success."
"One of the managers we coached confidently said, “My boss has no idea what I do."
"If it wasn’t for me, the company would have wasted thousands of dollars buying needless equipment.”
We don’t know about the equipment, but the executive was being coached because his employees were caught in a revolving door."
"None stayed for any length of time, and the last few, on the way out, had alleged that he was egotistical and arrogant."
"Stupid Behavior #5: Negativity
Although rare, from time to time, we conduct employee opinion surveys where we find the opinions of the management team are more negative than the opinions of the employees."
"We uncover this issue with the statement “This organization has an exciting future.” A second statement that helps to uncover employees’ feelings regarding the future is “My organization offers me the type of job I will want three years from now.” In the situations where employees’ opinions are higher than those of the management team, we feel like telling the managers to turn over control of the company to employees because they have an even more positive view of the organization’s future than the managers do."
"There is a reason why a compelling, positive vision of the future is the foundation for Best-of-the-Best organizations."
With negative visions come low aspirations.
"If managers don’t think the situation can be improved (vision), then they do not raise their levels of aspirations or set goals to improve the situation."
Poor visions with mediocre goals lead to a workforce with low morale.
"If you are a manager who has a negative vision combined with low aspirations for improvement, the greatest gift you can give to both yourself and the organization is to quit."
"Stupid Behavior #6: Failing to Communicate
In 1967, Paul Newman starred in a great movie, Cool Hand Luke."
"In this classic, Luke is sent to a prison camp for cutting the heads off of parking meters."
"When asked why he would do such a thing, the only explanation he gives is this: “Small town, not much to do in the eve- nin’.” But the greatest quote comes later in the movie when Strother Martin tells Paul Newman: “Now, what we have here is a failure to communicate.”
This insightful statement is applicable to managers who don’t appropriately communicate and, in turn, single-handedly undermine workplace excellence."
"There are several categories of communication blunders, including communication that is not timely, direct, or honest."
"Recently, in analyzing an organization’s employee opinion survey data, there were large discrepancies in response to the statement “Managers and supervisors at my company seek the opinions and thoughts of the employees who work here.” As outsiders viewing the culture from the employees’ perspective, it was clear to us that some managers asked for their employees’ ideas and opinions whereas others didn’t."
"We also noted that, in general, when responses to this and other statements about communication were more favorable within a department, scores throughout the whole survey likewise were higher."
"In other words, when people were asked for their insights and felt that their input was valued, they tended to be more positive about their relationship with their employer."
"We gained insight into that company’s organizational climate regarding employee input and innovation when one senior level manager said, “Just because we ask, it doesn’t necessarily mean we will take action on their input."
"They have to understand that we’ve been at this business for a long time and know what works and what doesn’t.”
Here is a sure-fire recipe for failure: Assume that you know more than your employees and that they don’t need to know anything other


than how to do their jobs."
"Just tell employees what you think they need to hear, and then sit back and try to have fun when the negative surprises start rising to your level!"
This is referred to as the Mushroom Theory of Management.
"These managers believe that, if you keep employees in the dark and feed them a load of manure, like mushrooms, they will do just fine."
Then there are the managers who are too busy for timely communication.
"They are so active keeping all the balls in the air, they feel they do not have time to communicate necessary information that would keep customers happy and employees successful."
"Because they feel everything is faster if they just do it themselves, they do not delegate."
"In haste, they cover up one mess only to create another because of the lack of communication."
"People in the organization are continually surprised because they find things out at the last minute or after the fact, when they cannot positively impact the outcome."
Another example of this stupid behavior is the failure to provide direct and honest feedback.
These managers go around telling everyone what they are thinking except for the person who actually could do something with the information.
"In interviews, we love to ask the question “Have you told your employees, boss, or peers that you have strong concerns about the way this project is progressing?” It is not uncommon for a manager who is struggling in the organization to look us in the eye and hesitantly say, “No.”
When we push managers on why there has not been direct communication, we hear the following excuses: They feel the feedback would not be appreciated; it is outside their scope of authority to give honest feedback; or, our favorite, “I was hoping they would figure it out and change without me needing to say anything.”
Some managers will actually lie when providing information or when directly asked a question."
It is almost impossible to build a relationship where people willingly follow you when you are perceived to be untrustworthy.
"We worked with an organization where, at an all- employee meeting, one person asked the CEO if there was going to be a layoff."
"The CEO, who had been working diligently with the senior management on executing the layoff at the end of the month, looked at all the employees and said, “No, it is not in my plans to do a layoff.”


This was a lie."
"As hard as it is to tell employees that their jobs may be jeopardized by a layoff, the honest thing to say would be, “As difficult as it is for me to talk about something as devastating as a layoff, I need you to know that a layoff is a very real possibility."
"My commitment to you is to communicate information to you as soon as we have specific numbers and a concrete plan of how we will take care of our people who are laid off.”
What is fascinating about people who do not consistently speak the truth is that when they want to really emphasize a point, they insert the phrase, “I am going to be honest with you.” Sometimes they even ask, “Can I be honest with you?” or “Can I be frank?” Every time we hear these words we feel like saying, “We are glad you are going to make this conversation special by being honest."
"Does this mean that you haven’t been honest before?”
Stupid Behavior #7: Talking First, Listening Later
The old saying that God gave us two ears and only one mouth and intended us to use them in that given proportion is applicable here."
"Managers who undermine workplace excellence have a tendency to talk first, and listen later—a lot later—and sometimes not at all."
"Not listening or asking questions to gain even more information is like walking into your doctor’s office and saying, “Doctor, I really hurt and need your help.” The doctor responds, “As a doctor for over 30 years, I am one of the best at helping people get better."
Here is a prescription.
Take four of the pills each day for 10 days.
"At the end of 10 days, you will feel better."
"Any questions?” Any patient with brains would have to be thinking: “You don’t want to know where I hurt, how long I have been hurting, or what have I done to try to make the hurt go away?”
One summer, I (Peter) went to the pharmacy to buy pain-relief medication for my youngest daughter who was stung by a bee."
"Because she was only 7 years old, and I wasn’t confident about what to buy, I went to the pharmacist, held up the Benadryl, and said, “My daughter was stung by a bee."
"Would this be a good thing for my daughter to take?” Without any thought, the pharmacist replied, “Yeah, it should work.” I walked away, shaking my head and thinking, She didn’t even ask questions like: How old is your daughter?"
Is she allergic to bees?
"How


long ago was she stung?"
How much swelling does she have?
Where was she stung?
"In my opinion, this pharmacist committed a form of malpractice."
"In reality, many managers commit leadership malpractice on a daily basis because they react without thinking and say something they later regret."
"Instead of opening their mouths and moving closer to their goals, they open their mouths and say something that moves them farther away from their goals."
They should have been asking questions and listening.
There are a few reasons these managers do not listen well.
"First, they do not feel they need to know new or additional information or that the new information will help them be better managers."
"Second, managers who do not actively listen believe they already know the answers."
"Third, managers who do not listen feel a strong need to control the conversation by doing all the talking."
These three reasons are powerful enough for many managers to lose the desire to be great listeners.
"Without the desire to listen, the impact on the manager’s colleagues is almost always the same: If given the choice, people would prefer not to work with the manager."
"Stupid Behavior #8: Yearning for Acceptance
One of the behaviors that gets managers into huge trouble is working hard to be friends with coworkers, or only doing things they think others in the organization will like."
"Recently, we asked a supervisor if she had coached an employee who was coming to work late and not meeting the standards of her job."
This supervisor responded with: “No.
"I have not talked with her about her performance because we are good friends.”
We were dumbfounded."
"What kind of true friend would exhibit behaviors like chronic tardiness and poor performance, which would undermine her supervisor’s/friend’s ability to be successful in her role?"
Undermining your supervisor’s/friend’s success at work is a twisted characteristic of friendship.
Recognizing and rewarding excellent performance is a key practice for organizations in the Best-of-the-Best Benchmark.
Managers who let a real or perceived friendship get in the way of identifying performance problems that affect the entire team are not likely to achieve the organization’s vision.
They are more likely to demoralize their most productive workers and lose them.
"In another organization, a supervisor told us that he did not give people honest feedback because he really cared about his direct reports and wanted them to like him as their supervisor."
"When supervisors tell us about not being honest with people because of their enormous need to be liked, we are reminded of the story of the old man, the young boy, and the donkey."
An old man and a young boy were walking a donkey down the highway.
"A car stopped and the driver told the old man, “This is crazy."
"You have a young boy walking with you and he should be riding on the perfectly healthy donkey.” So the old man, in an attempt to make the driver happy, put the boy on the donkey and started walking again."
"A little farther down the road, another car pulled over and a man said to the old man, “This is crazy."
The young boy is perfectly healthy.
You are an old man.
"You should be riding the donkey.” In an attempt to please the person, the old man took the boy off the donkey, climbed up, and they started walking once again."
"They had not been walking but a few minutes when another car slowed down and the driver stated to the old man, “The donkey is perfectly capable of carrying both of you."
"Both of you should be riding the donkey.” Once again, the pleasing old man lifted the young boy aboard and they both went down the street riding the donkey."
"Next, the donkey walked up to a creek, but would not step foot in the water."
Another passerby stopped and told the old man that he needed to get off and pull the donkey into the creek.
"He did so, but the donkey would not budge."
Someone else stopped by and told them that both the old man and the boy needed to tug the donkey.
This passerby even described the donkey as a stubborn teenager.
"Still yet, another person told the old man that the boy needed to pull and the old man needed to push the donkey into the water."
"Lastly, one sage, who was the owner of many donkeys, told the old man that both the old man and the boy needed to get behind the


donkey and push with all their might and, once in the water, the donkey would grudgingly walk to the other side."
"They took the latest advice to please the sage and pushed so hard that the donkey stumbled into the creek, broke his neck, and drowned."
"There is a moral to this story that applies to leadership: If you try to please everyone, you are going to lose your ass."
"Stupid Behavior #9: Exhibiting Poor Judgment
“What were you thinking?”
That is our favorite question to ask managers we are coaching who have been accused of exercising incredibly poor judgment."
So what constitutes poor judgment?
Here are a few examples.
"Managers show poor judgment when they:
 Talk negatively about one employee in front of another em- ployee."
"When managers do this, they think they are con- fiding in one employee and indirectly building an even stronger relationship with the employee to whom they are speaking."
"The reality is that, any time a manager speaks poorly about one employee to another employee, the per- son walks away thinking, “If he talks this nasty about others behind their backs, then what does he say about me when I am not present?”
 Speak negatively about their boss or organization."
Talk about biting the hand that feeds you!
"As a manager confides to others about how stupid the boss can be, the listeners are thinking the boss must be stupid for hiring someone who is not loyal and talks behind people’s backs."
It has been our experience that people who talk negatively about their boss or their organization eventually are asked to leave by that very boss.
" Believe that direct reports have a desire to become person- ally involved in a relationship with them, and then act on these desires."
We are the first to admit that many personal re- lationships began in a working environment.
"Unfortunately, the problem with becoming emotionally involved with a sub- ordinate is that it creates tremendous liabilities for the man- ager, the employee, and the organization."
 Use foul language or say inappropriate things to others.
"Although many of us may have been guilty of slipping occasionally, it’s important to recognize that foul language will work against you in a business environment."
"Stupid Behavior #10: Having Selective Hearing
Defensive managers tend to surround themselves with “yes” men and women."
They do not appreciate feedback that does not support what they believe.
These managers do not value the truth.
"They may re- spond with an emotional outburst of anger, tell the communicant why the message is wrong, start the silent treatment, or exclude the team member from the manager’s selected group of people who are allowed to give feedback."
The outcome of being defensive is that these managers produce an environment where they do not have a good grasp of reality and make decisions without having all the available information.
This vicious cy- cle starts because people do not feel comfortable sharing important information when they know that the manager won’t agree with the information that needs to be conveyed.
"For instance, in the interview phase of an executive coaching project, we were getting a consistent theme from employees."
"In a variety of different ways, employees were telling us that their boss was rude."
"When asked for examples, we heard things like: “He cuts you off when you’re speaking to him.” “He hangs up on you.” “He walks right by you, sees you, and doesn’t even say ‘hello.’” “He asks you a question and turns around and leaves before you are finished talk- ing.” One bold employee even said, “We’ve tried
talking to him about this."
He doesn’t want to know.
"It seems like if enough people tell you that you have a tail, you ought to turn around and take a look!”
We loved the employee’s advice!"
Managers who exhibit this stupid behavior just don’t want to know reality or don’t want to be confused by another point of view.
"Stupid Behavior #11: Not Trusting People
It is amazing how many managers hire good people and then don’t trust them to get the job done."
Managers who do not trust people don’t like to delegate because they feel a need to personally complete anything of importance.
This belief becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
"If you do not trust people, then you do not delegate."
"If you do not delegate, then you do not develop your team members’ skills to handle even greater responsibility."
"When people do not gain experience because you do not delegate, you confirm your initial belief that they cannot be trusted."
"Whether you believe you can or cannot trust people, you are right."
"Employees who believe that their boss trusts them go out of their way to demonstrate discretionary effort, which ensures they do not undermine the expectations and trust of their boss."
"If managers believe they cannot trust people and, hence, do not delegate, they are also right."
The employees do not have the necessary skills to fulfill the manager’s expectations.
There is a second problem that emerges when managers do not trust team members.
It does not take long before the staff does not trust the manager.
"This happens because people think, “I am a good and trustworthy person."
"I deserve to be communicated to, to be delegated to, and to assume even greater responsibility.” When the manager does not do this, direct reports start to believe that they cannot trust their manager."
The direct reports start to withhold information and the lack- of-trust cycle begins to grow.
Also under the umbrella of not trusting people is a desperate need to control everything.
"If these managers are not in total control, they are not comfortable."
"They worry that, if someone else does the job and it is not perfect, they will either not be able to fix the problem or it will reflect negatively on them."
"To maintain this high degree of control, these managers do not:
 Communicate necessary information in a timely manner, if at all."
 Delegate tasks to build up the capacity of both people and their organization.
" Schedule vacations because without them being there controlling everything, it will all fall apart or, worse, everyone will figure out that this control freak is not needed."
"Frequency: The Name of the Game
Why do managers exhibit these stupid behaviors?"
"While reading this chapter, there’s a good chance you nodded (and maybe laughed) in recognition."
"The longer your career has been, the more likely it is that you have encountered these types of behaviors."
"The difference is that poor managers choose to follow one or more of these behaviors frequently and, in some cases, to an extreme degree."
"Even when their peers, staff, and an executive coach ask questions and provide feedback to improve their leadership skills, they do not change the behaviors."
It’s a losing game.
Other managers are willing to learn and practice new approaches.
"They decide to develop a game plan that will improve their personal leadership skills and, consequently, the performance of their team and the organization itself."
We believe that it is possible to stop stupid behaviors and replace them with positive leadership skills.
"In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to do this from the Best-of-the-Best."
Think about your boss and answer the questions on the following quiz.
"For each of the questions, base your response on a period of time."
Do not generate your answer based on just one incident or action.
We all slip and do something stupid from time to time.
What gets managers in trouble is consistently doing stupid things.

"12-Step Recovery From Stupid Behaviors




It seems obvious, but it is worth stating: It’s vital to recover from stupid behaviors."
"Companies with higher levels of engaged employees are more productive and more likely to retain qualified, top-performing staff members."
"As a result, their organizations are more competitive and more successful."
"It is also important to emphasize again that every manager has done, or said, something in a working environment and then thought, “That was stupid.” Although some of the behaviors managers exhib- it can severely and negatively impact people in the organization, we strongly believe there is hope for these managers."
Remember: The highest-rated leaders in the Benchmarks were 26 points higher than the lowest-rated managers when their employees were asked about their ability to admit a mistake.
Great leaders are comfort- able admitting a mistake and then moving forward to make things better.
You can develop your skills as a leader and increase your value to the organization by following the 12 steps outlined in this chapter.
You will mitigate the impact of past stupid manager behaviors and lay a foundation on which to build successful future relationships.
"Step #1: Stop the Behavior
Although stopping sounds so easy, we have found that lifelong behaviors are some of the most difficult things to change."
"We recently


worked with a newly hired CEO who was charged with changing the culture of a 50-year-old financial institution."
The average length of service for employees was more than 15 years.
Keeping employees with this much experience was the good news.
The bad news was that it was much more difficult to implement change into the existing culture.
"This CEO, who suffered from Stupid Behavior #4 (“Thinking, ‘It’s All About Me’”) continually boasted about all the marvelous things he had done in his career and how lucky everyone was that he had decided to take this job."
"He reminded everyone that he “had several offers even better than this one.” To add insult to injury, this CEO continually put down the entire management team by repeatedly saying things such as, “You people really have no clue what great customer service looks like.” Another insult the CEO loved to lob to the entire executive team was, “There is not one mid-level manager in this organization who is capable of becoming a senior vice president.”
Not surprisingly, these comments destroyed morale, not only for the mid-level managers, but also for the executives who were convinced this CEO talked nastily about them as well."
We coached this CEO on several occasions about the importance of not putting down either individuals or groups in public.
"Each time we met, we reminded the CEO that this behavior destroys morale and he would achieve better results by saying “we” versus “you people” and focusing on building a positive future as a team versus putting down the past."
But the CEO never stopped exhibiting this stupid behavior.
"When he was finally asked to leave two years into his tenure, he left, saying, “Not one member of the board had the guts to stand up to these whiny employees.”
Changing behaviors is hard."
"It takes patience, commitment, and unwavering perseverance."
"Step #2: Admit You Made a Mistake
If you commit one of the 11 stupid behaviors, don’t make excuses."
Quickly come clean and tell people: “I messed up.
Here is my plan to fix my stupid action.
"If anyone has another suggestion for improvement for me, please tell me.” Or, “This time I really called that wrong."
I should have listened to what you were trying to tell me.
"I’ve learned from this mistake and will do things differently next time.”


Whether you made a mistake in a personal or professional relation- ship, acknowledging when you did so is a powerful step."
This is one of the key ways a leader can make a difference.
"As was stated before, when you are willing to admit a mistake, people are likely to forgive you."
"Step #3: Apologize
When you have done something that has had a negative impact on someone else, say, “I am sorry that what I did impacted you that way.”
We worked with a senior VP who became angry in a department meeting, and started to shout and swear while pounding his fist on the table."
The senior VP then abruptly ended the meeting and walked out.
"Needless to say, the department staff was a little quiet for the rest of the day."
"Later in the day, the senior VP called another department meeting."
Some team members thought they were being regrouped for a second ambush.
"Instead, he sat down and said, “This is going to be a short meet- ing."
I want everyone to know that what I did this morning was uncalled for.
I have felt terrible all day that I lost my cool.
"I totally misdirected my anger and I want everyone to know I am really sorry.” The manager went on to add, “When I thought about why I lost my cool, it is because I don’t know how to fix this problem."
"I am asking for your help.”
With those statements the manager became a leader."
"The meet- ing that was supposed to be over in five minutes went on for another hour, with most of the team members contributing solutions to solve the problem."
"Often, when we serve as executive coaches for managers who have been accused of doing something inappropriate in the workplace, it is apparent that the situation escalated because the managers would not own their actions and apologize."
We often hear this justification: “I won’t apologize because I didn’t do anything wrong.
They just took it wrong and overreacted.
"I’m not going to apologize because that would be admitting guilt, and I’m not guilty.”
Yet, in 99 percent of these scenarios, if the manager possessed the confidence and emotional maturity to genuinely say, “I’m sorry."
I apologize for what happened and how it made you feel.
"It won’t hap- pen again,” the situation would have been over and never escalated to the point where mediation was needed to resolve the dispute."
"In real life, when someone admits she made a mistake and apolo- gizes sincerely, it makes it much more difficult to stay angry with her."
"When managers summon the courage to admit a mistake and have the guts to apologize, we are convinced that they are much less likely to be hit by friendly fire, and far more likely to build trust and morale levels in the workplace."
People understand mistakes but retain little respect for managers who won’t own their behaviors and apologize for the impact of their actions on others.
"Step #4: Ask for Help
Some managers view asking for help as a sign of weakness or lack of confidence."
Exactly the opposite is true.
"Asking for help from your boss, your direct reports, your peers, or even a coach, is a sign of confidence and strength, and will help to increase your chances for success."
"It is important to realize that most people want you to be successful, and, when you ask for help, you can increase your chances of achieving success."
"The following tips will help you to get the assistance you need, when you need it."
"First, ask early in the process."
Waiting until the last minute becomes stressful for everyone.
"Rather than being motivated to help you achieve your goal, the person you are asking may even become resentful of your request."
"Second, be specific in your request for help."
"The more exact you are, the better your odds of getting help that is beneficial to achieving your goal."
"Third, give people a specific time frame for the help to be provided."
"Without a definite deadline, managers can end up doing the task on their own, even after they asked for aid, because no one knew when the help was needed."
This can also create an environment where people lose the desire to assist the manager in the future.
"Step #5: Give Credit Where Credit Is Due
Confident managers feel comfortable giving praise and recognizing people for their contributions to the organization’s success."
"The more genuine praise and recognition you give people, the more they will be motivated to help you, and the organization, achieve success."
"Though most managers spend a considerable amount of time thinking about workplace challenges and attempting to find solutions, great leaders also invest time thinking about what is going well and looking for opportunities to recognize and reward people for their positive contributions."
"The majority (86.7 percent) of the employees at Best-of-the-Best organizations felt that “I receive credit and recognition when I do a good job.” Their managers’ attitudes are “It’s all about them.”

Step #6: Take Responsibility
When the results are not what people expected, don’t complain, blame, or explain."
"Instead, take responsibility to correct the problem."
This is not the same thing as admitting you caused the problem.
"Most likely, you did not cause the problem."
What most organizations need are managers who focus 100 percent of their energy on correcting the problem and taking responsibility to ensure the results are in alignment with the organization’s goals.
"Great leaders truly believe that the gift they bring to the organization is the willingness to take responsibility to ensure the
organization achieves the best outcomes."
"When chal-
lenges arise, their responses are: “What went wrong?"
How are we going to fix it?
What did we learn from this?
"What will we do to ensure this doesn’t happen again in the future?”
When you answer these questions, you and your team can solve the problem."
"At the same time, you can identify the processes or performance gaps that may have led to the problem and fix these, too."
"You
can maintain accountability and avoid the stupid behavior of blaming others."
"Step #7: Focus on the Future
Managers who are famous for blaming others when things do not go as planned almost always focus on the past."
The fastest way out of this trap is to focus on the future by asking these two questions: Where do we want to be?
How do we get there?
Most people will drop their Cover Your Assets (CYA) mentality and pitch in to help solve problems if the discussion is focused on creating a positive future.
You already know that key number one and the first step to becoming a great leader is a positive and compelling vision of the future.
"Step #8: Take Action
Procrastination leads to serious problems for managers."
Most managers know what is right and what they need to do.
Managers who do stupid things make excuses for not taking action and doing what everyone knows needs to be done.
You are the role model for your team.
"To borrow a slogan from Nike, “Just do it.”
If you suffer from “T.N.T.” disease (I’ll do it…Tomorrow, Not Today), chances are your team is suffering, too."
"Prioritize, create a real- istic plan for getting your work accomplished, and then work your plan."
No excuses.
Just do it!
"Step #9: Think First and Then Speak
I don’t know about you, but I (Peter) cannot give constructive feed- back when I am angry or upset."
"It does not matter whether the situation involves my wife, my children, or an employee."
"When I am angry, my word choice is not effective in helping me move closer to my goal."
"So, if you are like me, what do you do?"
The best thing is to think about the situ- ation and respond to your counterpart when you are emotionally calm.
"During a coaching session, a manager who had gotten himself into trouble for responding defensively to a difficult employee said, “What people need to understand is that I get mad."
I yell.
"Then, it’s off my chest and I’m over it.” I said, “Yes."
It’s off your chest.
It’s on someone else’s chest.
"That’s what got you into trouble.” He said, “They need to just get over it.” I said, “They didn’t."
"That’s why you are here.”


Finally, he responded with, “I think this may be the most important thing I’ve learned so far in our work together."
"I can get over what I do, but it has a lasting impact on others."
I need to think about what I say before I say it.” This is a terrific example of a manager recovering from a stupid behavior!
Some managers have told us that the philosophy of not communi- cating at the moment is not being honest.
Honesty is wonderful.
We are in full support of frank communication.
But it is important to note that the words that come out of your mouth are permanent.
"If you can communicate when you are angry and are able to move closer to your long-term goals, then go for it."
"If your communication when you are angry moves you farther away from your goals, think first, and then speak."
"Step #10: Listen and Ask Questions
As our (Jane and Peter are siblings) 88-year-old dad is so fond of saying, “People like you a whole lot better when they are talking.” It’s so simple and so true."
Get others to speak first.
You can learn so much more about leadership when you listen.
"After your counterparts are finished talking, ask them open-ended questions to gain even more information and further clarification."
Be like a doctor who asks all the necessary questions so you can write an accurate prescription when you do finally open your mouth to speak.
There’s a very good reason why you should ask questions before you articulate your position: The most highly rated managers rate 23 percentage points higher on the scale when employees say they solicit opinions on work within their areas of responsibility.
"Step #11: Thank People
Please and thank you are words that go a long way in building or rebuilding strong relationships after a manager does something stupid."
Thank you is especially helpful when people give you feedback that either you did not want to hear or was difficult for the other person to share with you.
"Recently, I (Jane) conducted a telephone seminar."
"At the con- clusion, a participant e-mailed to let me know he felt that a point I


made—“Great managers keep their people uncomfortable”—was bad."
I thought about e-mailing the gentleman back to explain in more detail why I feel that this is an important concept for managers to understand and practice.
"Instead, I e-mailed the participant and thanked him for caring enough about me as a presenter to share his feedback."
Then I asked him for more details on why he felt my advice was inappropriate.
He e-mailed me back an additional two pages of clarifying feedback.
"After reading the additional two pages, I realized that he agreed with about 99 percent of what I said."
There was one small point he disagreed with.
"After he shared his example supporting his disagreement, I e-mailed him again and told him that, based on his unique example, I agreed with him."
Thanking people and getting even more information is a great strategy.
"Step #12: Be Grateful
One way to be grateful is to imagine coming to work tomorrow and finding that none of your employees have shown up."
What would you do?
There is no way you can run the whole department or organization all by yourself.
"If no one is following you, then you are not a leader."
"If you are going to be successful as a manager, you need people."
"As motivational speaker, Brian Tracy, often says in his speech- es, “Develop an attitude of gratitude, and give thanks for everything that happens to you, knowing that every step forward is a step toward achieving something bigger and better than your current situation.” Be grateful you:
 Are employed."
 Have customers.
 Have a team who needs you.
 Have a loving family and friends.
 Have a supervisor who values your contribution.
 Are in this position because you can make a difference.
 Are alive!
"Move Forward Into a Positive Leadership Role
About 50 percent of the managers we coach who have been ac- cused of exhibiting stupid behaviors turn their reputations around and become positive managers and role models in their organizations."
"You might ask, “What happens to the other 50 percent?”
The other 50 percent exhibit what we call “Popeye syndrome.” Popeye, the famous cartoon character, is famous for saying “I’m Popeye the Sailor Man."
I am what I am and that’s all that I am.” He is an interesting role model for managers who exhibit stupid behaviors.
Is there any cure for Popeye syndrome?
Yes.
Popeye also demon- strated the ability to recover.
"After eating a can of spinach, he could overcome any obstacle, and no barrier was too large."
"He is an inspiring role model for the manager who says “I can learn from, change, and fix these past stupid mistakes."
"Watch me go!”
You can recover from stupid behaviors and replace them with the leadership skills exhibited by the highest-rated managers."
You can start right now.

CREATING WORKPLACE EXCELLENCE






The 76 Strategies




Are you a leader who inspires innovative thinking and top perfor- mance?"
"If you are not, the 10 Keys to Workplace Excellence will open new ways to engage employees and build an army of loyal customers."
"Even better, the 10 keys previously outlined align with the 76 strategies described in this chapter, which are used by companies in the Best-of- the-Best Benchmark."
"We know that there are some natural leaders, but most of us need to continually learn or refresh our management skills."
It’s inspiring to remember that about half of the managers we coach make changes and move forward as higher-performing leaders.
"The 76 strategies, with examples of how Best-of-the-Best leaders put them into practice, will help you do the same thing."
"Day after day, your actions create your work environment."
That doesn’t mean that you suddenly need to put all 76 strategies into action at once.
It will benefit you and your team to start implementing them with the same strategic vision you apply to your organization’s product.
One leader can make a tremendous difference—either positive or negative.
Are you a leader who exhibits and inspires the spirit of workplace excellence as you walk through the door?
"If not, here is what you can do."
"Key #1: A Compelling, Positive Vision With Clear Goals
There is a reason why a compelling, positive vision is the first key to workplace excellence."
How can you get there if you don’t know where you are going?
Ninety percent of employees at Best-of-the-Best organizations understand their company’s goals.
"But the clearest vision in the world will only be effective if it’s communicated to employees, and if everyone’s actions—including senior managers’— strive to fulfill the vision."
"Strategy 1: Communicate Your Organization’s Purpose
Purpose is a powerful motivator that clearly defines your organi- zation’s reason for existence."
It answers the question “Why?” rather than simply explaining what you do and how you do it.
"Your purpose, when clearly articulated, explains from your customers’ viewpoint what your business is."
"For example, our company is a management consult- ing firm whose purpose is clear."
We are focused on helping our clients create an environment where employees love to come to work and cus- tomers love to do business.
We align every service we provide and every product we produce with this purpose.
"Examples of some well-known organizations with clear purposes are listed here:
 Starbucks—committed to being premier purveyor of the finest coffee in the world."
 3M—solve unsolved problems innovatively.
 Disney—make people happy.
 Mary Kay—offer women unlimited opportunities.
 Merck—provide society with superior products and services by developing innovations and solutions that improve the quality of life.
" Southwest Airlines—dedication to the highest quality of customer service delivered with a sense of warmth, friendliness, individual pride, and company spirit."
What purpose or higher cause drives your team or organization?
Employees tend to raise their motivation and productivity to a higher level when a clear purpose or higher cause channels their work.
Every employee on your team needs to under- stand how your organization’s purpose and their individual actions contribute to your organiza- tion’s success.
"To remain motivated, loyal, and enthusiastic, people need to be connected to a meaningful purpose."
Clearly identify and commu- nicate your purpose loudly and often.
“A leader has the vision and conviction that a dream can be achieved.
"He inspires the power and energy to get it done.”
—Ralph Lauren
Strategy 2: Get Excited About Tomorrow
George Burns once said, “Every morning, the first thing I do is get up and read the obituary section of the newspaper."
"If my name is not in there, it is going to be a great day.” George Burns was also the person who scheduled a performance at the London Palladium on his 100th birthday."
That is a powerful positive vision of the future.
"One day, someone asked Burns how long he felt he was going to live."
"Burns replied, “How can I die?"
"I’m booked.” Although Burns did not make the concert at the London Palladium, he did live to celebrate his 100th birthday."
Are you a glass-half-full or a glass-half-empty type of leader?
Some people you work with can make both work and life seem like a chore.
I (Jane) once asked an unhappy employee why he stayed at an organization.
"He responded, “Six years, five months, and four days until I retire.” That response sounds more like a prison sentence than a career, but he does get to go home at night for a conjugal visit."
"What is sad is that we believe this individual is, most likely, not excited about his personal life, either."
"It is very difficult to say, “I hate my job, but at 5:00 p.m., I become excited about my life.” Life doesn’t work that way."
The best way to be excited about tomorrow is to have things to do.
"We are excited about:
 Developing our next book."
 Guiding the executives we are working with to become more successful leaders.
 Helping our staff grow.
 Taking our firm to the next level.
" Watching our teenagers, who know everything, grow up, go to college, and move out of the house!"
What are you excited about?
"What do you love about life, your career, and your organization?"
What is on your to-do list?
To be excited about coming to work each day—because you love what you do and who you work with—promotes workplace excellence.
"When you really love what you do, it is not just a job."
Leaders who are excited about tomorrow attract more followers who are motivated to accomplish the organization’s goals.
"“Anything’s possible if you’ve got enough nerve.”
—J.K."
"Rowling
Strategy 3: Have High Expectations
When it comes to change in organizations, there is no greater resistance than in the field of education."
"If not proven in theory and written about in books, then educators do not see a reason to change."
"However, a few renegade school districts are changing the paradigm in the business of education."
"The Poway Unified School District (PUSD) in Poway, California, is rated as one of the top districts in the country for kindergarten through 12th grade."
"For more than 25 years, PUSD had the same superintendent, who built a national reputation for excellence."
"We are convinced that home prices in this district are inflated by an extra $200,000 to $300,000 because of the school’s reputation."
"When you have a reputation this strong, you focus on maintaining what you have rather than taking your success to a higher level."
"In 2001, PUSD hired a new superintendent, Don Phillips, to lead the district."
"When you inherit a success, how you make it better is a major concern."
"In the last decade, most school districts have transitioned from a vision of “Every child can learn” to “Every child will learn.” The second vision, “Every child will learn,” holds the district and its employees more accountable for the educational success of every child."
"When Phillips and his cabinet came together, they formed a new vision that took “Every child will learn” to a higher level."
"PUSD’s new


vision is “Every child will graduate college-ready.” Who could argue with this vision?"
"However, something new or different will always stir opposition."
"As we shared this vision with an educator in another district, the educator looked at us and said, “I don’t like that vision."
I believe that every child should graduate with the maximum number of options.” We were dumbfounded.
"If students graduate college-ready, how would their options not be maximized?"
There will always be resistance to high expectations.
Resistance is expected.
Only when you overcome that resistance and reach a higher level of success will morale and workplace excellence improve.
"Although some consider it a cliché, we still value the words in this phrase: “Shoot for the moon."
"If you miss, at least you will land on a star.” People do not feel good about setting mediocre goals and expectations."
They feel exactly that—mediocre—when they achieve a mediocre goal.
"“Unless a man undertakes more than he possibly can do, he will never do all that he can.”
—Henry Drummond
Strategy 4: Create a PLV (Personal Leadership Vision)
If you want your team members to follow your lead, you’ve got to be absolutely clear about who you are and what you will or will not stand for."
A Personal Leadership Vision is extremely important.
"This vision, which has nothing to do with your department’s or organization’s vision, is a clear mental picture of how you want others to see you as a leader."
"Here is an example:
I am a leader who truly values the contributions of my people and cares about them as individuals."
"I am also an enthusiastic leader who has the reputation for taking responsibility, getting things done, and taking calculated risks when necessary."
I enjoy the work I do and create an environment in which people have fun!
"The following four suggestions will help you create a Personal Leadership Vision:


 Focus on what you would like your followers to say about you as a leader."
" Write down what you want, not what you do not want."
 Make daily decisions and take actions that support the vision.
 Do not share your vision until you have “walked your talk” for one year.
"Developing a Personal Leadership Vision can be a daunting task, so use this technique to make the process easier: Imagine you are being honored at your retirement party."
"Gathered to pay tribute are more than 100 people who were your bosses, peers, staff people, and customers."
Several guests approach the podium to say a few words about the type of manager and person you have been throughout the years.
Assume you had an illustrious career.
What would you like your bosses to say about you?
"How about your peers, staff members, and customers?"
What qualities do you hope they would mention?
What important contributions will you have made to the organization and to the individual lives of your coworkers?
"Now, create your PLV."
"The best Personal Leadership Visions are concise and easy to remember, and evoke passion and commitment."
“People are more inclined to be drawn in if their leader has a compelling vision.
"Great leaders help people get in touch
with their own aspirations and then will help them forge those aspirations into a personal vision.”
—John Kotter
Strategy 5: Set Goals to Turn Your Vision Into Reality
Here is a simple way to think about goals: Goals are the “I think I cans” of life."
"When you combine “I think I can” with “I did it,” you gain mastery over your life."
"Abraham Maslow said in Motivation and Personality, “No matter how old you are, the day you cannot sit down and come up with a want list, you are in trouble; you are on the way out.”1
In working with thousands of supervisors in diverse settings, we noticed that great leaders always have a set of clearly defined goals."
We also noted the reverse.
"Supervisors who struggle in relationships with employees and have difficulty getting their team motivated often express only one ambition: “Just let me survive one more day!”
The accomplishment of anything momentous begins with clear goals."
"Most people would agree with this statement, yet they lack goals in both their personal and professional lives."
Some studies have found that up to 90 percent of the population does not set goals.
"Without objectives, you spend the majority of your time reacting to—instead of creating— your environment."
"If you can conceive and believe in your goals, and then take the necessary actions, you can achieve them."
"It is important to realize that achieving any goal takes persistence, commitment, and a willingness to forego temporary pleasures."
Yoda in Star Wars was right.
"When Luke Skywalker says, “All right, I’ll give it a try,”
Yoda responds, “No."
Try not.
Do or do not.
"There is no try.” That is why in a marriage cer- emony when the official asks if you take your spouse for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, from this day forward until death do you part, the appropriate response is “I do”— not “I’ll try.”
Goals can be powerful motivators."
"Goals give you a well-defined purpose, a sense of accomplishment, and a feeling of mastery over your environment."
"As you set goals, ensure they meet the SMART test: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound."
"Whether you choose to be a committed goal-setter or a ship floundering at sea, you must realize one thing: Whatever you do with your life, you write your own ticket."
“The tragedy of life doesn’t lie in not reaching your goal.
"The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach.”
—Benjamin E. Mays
Strategy 6: Create a Sense of Urgency
In today’s business world, speed has tremendous value."
"Un- fortunately, some leaders feel that by changing things slowly, people will not be upset."
"Years ago, transitioning word processing from WordPerfect to MSWord was a big deal."
One organization announced that it was converting from WordPerfect to Word in six months.
"Angry employees said, “Fine, but I am not going to convert."
"I am a WordPerfect user.”
Three months before the conversion, the organization started to train the staff on Word."
"Resisters said, “That’s nice to know, but I do not need to attend the training because I am not giving up WordPerfect.” A month before the conversion, designated trainers from the information technology and human resources departments went out and corralled the few deviant employees into the last training session."
"At the six-month mark, the conversion took place and the staff had moved through the four stages of change: denial, anger, partial trial, and acceptance."
Another organization practiced fast change.
"On a Friday night, the leaders, who did not notify employees, deleted everyone’s WordPerfect and aligned employees’ files with Word."
"On Monday morning, there were many upset people running around saying, “That’s okay, I’ll find my WordPerfect in the electronic recycle bin.” Others were agitated."
"“How could anyone be so stupid as to take old software off our computers without training us on how to use the new software?”
By 11 a.m., others were saying that Word was virtually the same as WordPerfect, except for bullets, paragraph indentions, and pagination."
By 4 p.m. some people were saying they loved the new software and couldn’t believe it took so long for the change.
"For the first organization, time (six months) was wasted in implementing the conversion."
The second organization took only one day to move people through the cycle of change.
"When it comes to the speed of change, how much time does your organization have?"
“People don’t resist change.
"They resist being changed!”
—Peter Senge
Strategy 7: Align Structure for the Best Interests of the Organization
Is your organizational structure designed in your organization’s best interest to achieve the vision?"
Or has your organizational structure been planned around personalities?
"When organizations arrange their


organizational structure around employees who like each other and/or who refuse to work for certain people, it makes it harder to achieve the vision and difficult to create workplace excellence."
"Recently, one organization we work with acquired a competitor."
The acquiring organization arranged a new organizational structure and informed the purchased company.
Several major leaders in the acquired company told the buyer they would quit if they had to report to the “new” CEO.
"By accepting its role of “hostage,” the acquiring company allowed the leaders to report to the people they liked."
"Obviously, this approach spelled disaster, and a year later, we were hired to help this organization better understand why making changes was hard, why there was little teamwork at the executive level, and why morale was so low."
"When organizational structures are based on personalities, it shields employees from changing their routines or delivering better results."
"To help bring the organizational structure into alignment, ask yourself this question: If we were to leave personalities out of the decision and design an organizational structure that made the most sense in helping to achieve the organization’s vision, what would be the optimal functional organizational structure?"
The answer will lead you to a better outcome.
"For those who insist upon structures designed around personalities, we’re grateful."
They create more consulting projects for us!
“I used to think that running an organization was equivalent to conducting a symphony orchestra.
But I don’t think that’s quite it; it’s more like jazz.
"There is more improvisation.”
—Warren Bennis

Key #2: Communication—The Right Stuff at the Right Time
Communication is a powerful strategy."
"When a company encourages employees to express opinions and managers relay the organization’s perspective, a team is formed that immediately works to realize the organization’s vision."
"According to 87 percent of employees in our surveys, leaders in the Best-of-the-Best Benchmark keep employees informed about the company’s plans."
"They even communicate bad


news."
"And, because they give serious consideration to their staff’s input, Best-of-the-Best leaders are in that elite category of two-way communicators."
"Strategy 8: Tell the Truth
On February 9, 2001, Navy Commander Scott Waddle gave an or- der to perform an emergency maneuver to rapidly surface the 9,000- ton nuclear attack submarine Greenville."
"In a span of eight minutes, Commander Waddle’s life forever changed."
"Nine miles off Oahu, the Greenville ripped through the surface of the water and smashed the hull of the Ehime Maru, a Japanese fishing boat."
"The Ehime Maru sank within minutes, and nine Japanese fishermen died in this tragic acci- dent."
"To make matters worse, Commander Waddle had been enter- taining civilian guests on the submarine, and two were at the controls at the moment of impact."
"In Commander Waddle’s book, The Right Thing (Integrity Publishers, 2002), he describes his attorney, Charles Dickens, telling him, “I’ll kill you before I allow you to take the stand and testify without immunity."
"On second thought, I won’t have to do it."
"You’ll be killing yourself!”
Waddle knew his attorney was trying to protect him, but he felt com- pelled to take the stand and tell the truth about what happened."
"Waddle told his attorney, “There’s a time to be silent and a time to speak up for what is right."
I’m not the only guy who really knows what happened aboard that ship that day.
I’m the only one who knows what I saw through the periscope.
I have to tell the truth; I have to take responsibility and let the chips fall where they might.
"It’s the right thing to do.”
Waddle was devastated that nine people were dead."
"He said, “If I was going down, I wanted the truth to be known."
"Beyond that, my crew was my family."
"I didn’t want anyone else to go down with me.” Honesty, when it costs you significantly, is a powerful principle in great leadership."
"On Friday, December 13, 2002, Scott Waddle made a trip to Japan to offer his personal apologies to the family members of the victims of the accident between the Ehime Maru and the Greenville."
"To the Japanese, Scott’s apology was a gesture of integrity, humility, and honor."
Establishing a workplace environment of honesty and integrity is extremely important to the future of your business.
"Being honest and up front with your employees and management team about their


performance is essential for progress and success."
"If you are a leader respected by both employees and customers, you will receive the benefit of solid relationships and your organization will experience the reward on the balance sheet."
"“If you tell the truth you don’t have to remember anything.”
—Mark Twain
Strategy 9: Communicate Vision and Goals to Everyone—and Do It Often
Once your vision is set it will be critical to your success to com- municate the vision many times in many ways."
"In a survey conducted by Right Management Consultants, two-thirds of employees did not understand their employer’s business strategy and were not passionate about their jobs."
The noteworthy reason for this lack of clarity was that 28 percent of the companies surveyed only communicated this information to their leadership teams; 24 percent had not yet communicated this information to employees; and 15 percent were not sure about the best method to communicate this information.
"The lack of communication resulted in lower employee buy-in, lower productivity, and lower product quality."
"Richard M. Kovacevich, former CEO of Wells Fargo, is a great example of a leader who preached a vision over and over."
"In 1999, Wells Fargo had four financial products in its customers’ households."
Kovacevich believed that the average consumer purchased 15 financial products.
"His vision was for consumers to obtain half of the products for Wells Fargo, with a goal of eight Wells Fargo products in each customer’s household."
"To spread this message, Kovacevich placed updates on the goal in annual reports, in Wall Street publications, and in all employee com- munications."
"By November 2008, John Stumpf, the new CEO of Wells Fargo, reported a record 5.64 products per household.2 Wells Fargo em- ployees are aware of and focused on the vision."
Wall Street analysts pay attention to the vision.
Even stockholders are clear about the vision.
Wells Fargo is striving to earn more profits from their customers and steal business from competitors.
"Although many financial institutions are excited when they cross-sell one product to a customer, Wells Fargo has a bigger vision—and all the key players are clear about the goal."
“The very essence of leadership is that you have a vision.
It’s got to be a vision you articulate clearly and forcefully on every occasion.
"You can’t blow an uncertain trumpet.”
—Theodore Hesburgh
Strategy 10: Create and Communicate Crystal-Clear Roles and Responsibilities
When roles and responsibilities are muddy, accountability is impos- sible."
Some people actually prefer to work in organizations where roles and responsibilities are blurred because they always have an excuse and someone to blame for poor performance.
Some managers instigate chaos by asking many people to do the same task.
Other managers ask employees to do tasks that are traditionally associated with other areas in the organization.
This generates confusion and makes it easy for employees to dodge accountability.
Top performers do not like working for organizations where they are not clear on what is expected from them.
"That helps explain why 85 percent of the employees at Best-of-the-Best organizations feel their responsibilities are clearly defined, and an outstanding 93 percent say they understand the organization’s performance standards and measurements."
"When employees are not clear about their role in accomplishing the organization’s goals and what they are responsible for achieving, you may as well blindfold them, spin them around 10 times, and tell them to go hit the target."
"When your organization’s vision, goals, and roles are clear, knowing your purpose and the results you are responsible for producing is easy."
"“Good men prefer to be accountable.”
—Michael Edwards
Strategy 11: Lead With an Open-Mind Policy
Most leaders say they have an open-door policy, but employees find out quickly that, although the door is open, the mind is closed."
"One employee we interviewed summed up his boss’s open-door policy by saying, “My boss’s mind is a lot like concrete—thoroughly mixed and set like stone.”


If you have an open-door policy, it means you welcome people to your office with their ideas, comments, complaints, and suggestions."
It also means that you actively listen to and honestly respond to those who come to see you.
"Here are a few tips:
 When people come into your office, invite them to sit down."
 Listen carefully and attentively.
"Someone came to you, not vice versa."
Let the employee talk.
 Ask open-ended questions to seek understanding before you advise.
 Ask the person if there is any action you need to take.
" When people bring you information, thank them."
Especially when the information is hard to handle—something you do not want to hear or a problem that you do not want to deal with—thank them.
 Follow up and take action.
"If you fail to take action and communicate those actions, people will think, “Why bother?”
 Make it your goal to have a solid understanding of your organization and ask yourself: “Are the right people coming to me so I have a complete picture from different perspectives?”
“Of all the skills of leadership, listening is the most valuable— and one of the least understood."
"Most captains of industry listen only sometimes, and they remain ordinary leaders."
"But a few, the great ones, never stop listening."
"That’s how they get word before anyone else of unseen problems and opportunities.”
—Peter Nulty
Strategy 12: Ask Instead of Tell
After more than 20 years of coaching managers and executives, we identified a pattern with leaders who struggle to build relationships: They don’t ask—they tell."
"Sometimes they find it difficult to build a relationship with a boss, peers, or direct reports."
We interviewed a county sheriff who said that his captain yelled at deputies for wasting gas by leaving their squad cars running in the station yard.
"The captain barked, “I don’t care what the reason is."
"Turn your cars off when you are at the station.” This deputy went on to add, “You’d think he would ask why we leave the cars running."
"If he had asked, we would have been able to tell our captain that it takes four minutes to get the on-board computer up and online when we start the car.” Four minutes is valuable time when you are being dispatched from the station on an emergency call."
"We joke about leaders like this sheriff by saying, “You can try to tell him, but you can’t tell him much."
Don’t try.” There are two reasons why we are called to work with struggling managers.
"First, they are the best “tellers” in the organization."
They tell everyone what to do.
"Second, when they are wrong or there is a better way to do things, they do not like to listen to feedback."
"In organizations, executives run to the president to let him know this individual—the teller—is not a team player and is very difficult to communicate with."
The direct reports and peers run to human resources to ask for help.
"Eventually someone says, “The manager needs a coach.”
A vice president of human resources forwarded us this e-mail, which includes the original typos, that a manager sent to his team."
We could not make this one up.
"To: All Staff
Subject: Changes are Coming!"
My patience has officially run out!
There are some changes coming to our office.
"If you have not figured it out, I will hold you accountable."
In fact if I have to rebuild this market from scratch I will.
The first wave of misfits have been removed.
A second wave is coming.
If you doubt I have the authority you are sadly mistaken.
I came here to hold each of you accountable for your activity and to get this market to perform as expected.
"Since being here I
have uncovered a lot of dirt, lack of activity, and the wrong activities, which is sad based on the opportunity and future you could have here."
Ever area (position) of the business is under a microscope.
"Quite frankly I am tired of not receiving reports on time, or not receiving them at all, failure to follow simple directions and or request, lack of tracking in areas of the business that MUST be tracked."
I am tired of folks not taking personal responsibility for success or failures in their area of the business.
I have had dealers with out inventory and sales people missing inventory.
"I have sales people not answering phone calls, or answering the calls two hours to a day late."
"We have favoritism running rampant in the office, people over reaching on their authority and we have clicks and too much gossip."
I see people taking extended lunches and others not clocking out for lunch when taken.
I see poor time management.
I see an unwillingness to hold outside relationships accountable.
I see a lack of urgency when urgency is required.
I can accept nothing less than having the right people on the bus.
As a manager I must inspect what I expect.
I don’t like what I am uncovering.
Changes are coming!
"The only thing this manager did not tell the staff was this: “Firings will continue until morale improves.”
When the memo writer was questioned about his style of communi- cation, he told the VP of human resources, “Hey, people may not like my style of communication, but I am paid to do a job."
"And I am just doing my job.” We are all paid to do a job, but how we achieve results is also important."
This manager was fired shortly after he wrote the memo.
"If you want to lead successfully, ask questions."
Ask people for their opinions and how you can help them accomplish their goals.
"When things go wrong, invite their suggestions as well as their commitment to solve the problems."
"Although the fix is a simple one, our experience is that only about half of the managers we work with are able to do it."
"The other half tell you why they are the way they are, and how the rest of the world is messed up and does not understand why they do the things they do."
"“To promote cooperation, remember: people tend to resist what is forced upon them."
"People tend to support that which they help to create.”
—Vince Pfaff


Strategy 13: Know Reality With MBWA (Management by Walking Around)
The higher you rise in your organization, the greater are the chances of being out of touch with front-line employees and customers."
"Today, more and more managers are hiding behind paperwork and are stuck in meetings."
This lack of contact with the people who are doing the work causes cracks in communication.
"Reducing the number of meetings and getting out of your office to talk with employees provides the following opportunities because you can:
 Learn what projects people are working on."
 Catch people doing great work and present them with praise and recognition.
 Offer coaching when people are not on track or need support.
 Keep in touch with the changing realities of departments and the organization.
Employees may not respond or may communicate very cautiously at first.
"But through time, you will be able to understand and respond to their concerns and needs."
"In one employee opinion survey we conducted, mid-level managers scored nearly 30-percent lower than the executive team on favorable responses to the statement “Our company has a good understanding of our customers’ needs.”
When executives saw the discrepancy, several started to chime in about why middle managers thought differently than the executives."
A few implied that the managers might not share the same perspective that the executives had about their customers.
"One executive asked, “More than 250 mid-level managers contributed feedback on this survey and only 12 executives."
"Is it possible that 250 people may have a clearer picture of reality than we do?”
Another executive said, “We need to get out of the ivory tower and speak to managers one-on-one, beginning the conversation with, ‘Middle managers see something that executives are missing when it comes to the needs of our customers."
"We think you have insight and would like to learn more from you about understanding our customers’ needs and improving our products and services.’”


MBWA works well for leaders who are engaged in the daily activities of the business and are committed to spending a percentage of their time every day on the floor and in their offices with employees."
"To be effective, this approach must be compatible with your management style."
"It cannot be artificial, and you must be committed to use what you learn."
Employees will see through you if you are just doing this to check it off your to-do list.
Walk through the building looking for opportunities to give positive comments and receive input and feedback.
"The more you get out of your office, speak to people, and listen intently, the more accurate your perspective will be."
"If you think you already know the answers, people will be reluctant to tell you the truth."
"“In organizations, real power and energy is generated through relationships."
"The patterns of relationships and the capacities to form them are more important than tasks, functions, roles, and positions.”
—Margaret Wheatly
Strategy 14: Eliminate the Communication Lag Time
One way to achieve workplace excellence is to remove lag time from your communication, especially the time between making a decision and the time it takes you to inform the people it will affect."
"Between 1964 and 1969, there was a classic sitcom on television called Gomer Pyle, USMC."
"Gomer Pyle, played by Jim Nabors, was a bumbling recruit who was always getting into trouble and could never please his drill instructor, Sergeant Carter."
Gomer had some priceless expressions that we still remember.
"One that made Jim Nabors famous was “Shazam, shazam.” Another was “Goooolly.” Our favorite was “Surprise, surprise, surprise!” In one episode, Gomer said to Sergeant Carter, with excitement, “Surprise, surprise, surprise!"
"We have both been dating the same gal!”
None of Gomer’s surprises were good."
The same concept applies to surprises in the organizational world.
"Most surprises to team members are negative, not positive."
"For example:


 The project you were working on has been canceled."
"Surprise, surprise, surprise!"
 We have hired someone who you will be reporting to— starting tomorrow.
"Surprise, surprise, surprise!"
 This order needs to be shipped by the end of the week.
"Surprise, surprise, surprise!"
" You made an unnecessary flight because today’s meeting was cancelled late last night, but we forgot to tell you."
"Surprise, surprise, surprise!"
"In an interview about organizational opportunities for improvement, an employee told us that the organization’s communication style was NETMA (No One Ever Tells Me Anything)."
It’s amazing how much information is considered so confidential that it cannot be communicated until the last minute.
"Of course, some things are highly confidential, such as ironing out the financial terms of a merger between publicly traded companies."
Any information that leaks out could have a devastating effect on the deal.
"Most things that need to be communicated, however, are not secrets and can be communicated quickly."
"When you eliminate lag time, employees feel much more valued and are more willing to help you implement the decision."
"“We know communication is a problem, but the company is not going to discuss it with employees.”
—Switching Supervisor, AT&T Long Lines Division
Strategy 15: Invite HR to the Big Dance
There is nothing more important to an organization than who gets hired, fired, or promoted."
"Too often, senior management leaves human resources out of these decisions."
"Instead of the HR director or VP sitting at the table where the decisions are made, the president or the CFO represents their function."
"We can often find a senior HR leader taking photos for the company newsletter, planning the holiday party, or being the top cop enforcing a senseless policy."
"The HR team can add value and earn the right to sit at the table in the following six areas:


 Recruit and develop the top talent in the industry."
 Assist in the design and plan of company business strategies.
 Design the organizational structure that accomplishes the strategies and goals.
 Recommend the measurements for success.
 Resolve conflicts that cause leaders to lose sight of the company’s vision and goals.
 Assess mergers or acquisitions.
"If HR leaders want to be contributing members at the big table, they need to:
 Focus on bottom-line results that drive the organization’s success."
 Quantify the value their department adds to the organization.
 Understand and make decisions that support how business works.
 Cut red tape that stops people from doing their jobs.
"When you have an effective human resources leader who understands the business, great things can happen."
"“HR should be every company’s ‘killer app.’”
—Jack Welch
Strategy 16: In Times of Crisis, Get Calmer Have you ever worked with someone who can take a small problem and blow it out of proportion so that everyone in the organization ends up sharing in the drama?"
"When leaders exaggerate a problem, they telegraph to the en- tire organization that they do not possess the
skills to deal with a major issue."
"In the 1970s, I (Peter) earned my way through college by driving an ambulance."
"On one occasion, I was called to an automobile accident that had two fatalities and multiple victims."
"Six months of emergency


training had not totally prepared me for this."
"I ran back and forth between the victims and the ambulance, yelling at people who were trying to help."
I was in over my head and I knew it.
"At the end of the call, I asked my partner, Big Louie, why no one was listening to me at the scene and why everyone was taking direction from him."
Big Louie gave me a wake-up call: “Because I can cut it.
"When you are more nervous and rattled than the victims and people at the scene, you don’t give people confidence you can help."
"Instead, you make the scene worse than before we arrived.”
The worse the scene, the calmer you need to be."
"In times of crisis, great leaders get calmer."
They recognize they have been called to lead the organization.
People do not follow leaders who lack confidence to lead the organization out of crisis.
The greatness of a leader is in direct proportion to the size of the crisis that can be handled.
"“You gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face."
"You must do the thing you think you cannot do.”
—Eleanor Roosevelt
Strategy 17: Focus on What’s Important
The most significant event in my (Peter’s) life was in 1998 when my 14-year-old daughter, Brittany, passed away waiting for a heart transplant."
"For two years during the time she was ill, I lived day-to-day."
Some days were perfectly normal.
"Other days, Brittany’s heart would not properly function, her implanted defibrillator would go off, and my life, along with the things on my to-do list, came to a screeching halt."
Once I had to call a client to cancel a keynote engagement be- cause Life Flight had taken Brittany to the hospital.
"The client’s only response was, “Based on your references when I hired you, I thought we could depend on you.” I was devastated."
"Later that day, when I talked with my friend Kevin Freiberg (coauthor with Jackie Freiberg of Boom!"
"[Thomas Nelson, 2007], Nuts!"
"[Broadway Books, 1998], and Guts!"
"[Currency Doubleday, 2004]), Kevin put it into perspective by telling me, “If she cannot understand what you are going through, that’s not your client.” Two years later, the same woman was at another organization and she asked me to work with her."
The decision to say no to the request was an easy one.
"A client who did understand when I called him to reschedule was Betteravia Farms, one of the largest produce growers in California."
"Joe Prandini, general manager and co-owner, called me and said, “We talked about Brittany’s situation this morning in the owner’s meeting."
"If you get a call that an organ is available, we can have our plane in the air within 30 minutes to get you anywhere you need to go."
"Please call us if we can help.”
Major challenges are your opportunity to live your values."
"For example, when women take maternity leave in our organization, we have only one goal: to keep all the systems in place so the new mom can take all the time she wants to bond with her child."
Is it easy?
No.
"Every time someone on our team takes time off, we are nervous that our business needs will not be met."
It’s critical to ensure that our clients will experience no difference in the service they expect.
But the long-term result of doing the right thing is a highly dedicated and engaged workforce who will go to the wall to help get things done.
"Whatever your organizational style, you can focus on the right thing at the right time."
"My wife, Kathleen, has a great saying: “When you are born, that is really big stuff."
"When you die, that is also really big stuff."
"Everything else is little stuff.” As a leader, your success is dependent on your ability to put things into perspective and focus on what’s important."
"“The least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it.”
—Carl Gustav Jung
Strategy 18: Promise Problems While Promising Solutions
One of the all-time great examples of promising problems was the Y2K disaster."
"We were all expecting to wake up on January 1, 2000, and find that computers and technology no longer functioned."
"From the 1960s to the 1980s there was a widespread practice in computer software of using two, rather than four, digits for representing a year."
This was done to save computer disk and memory space because these resources were relatively expensive in those days.
"As the ’90s approached, experts began to realize this major shortcoming in the computer software applications."
"Everyone feared that in the year 2000


the computer systems would interpret “00” as 1900, and send us all technologically backward by 100 years."
"Consequently, a major scare was initiated in almost every industry."
"Nicknamed the Y2K bug, the two-digit year was called a “clicking time bomb” for all major computer applications."
"For almost two years, IT personnel could not accomplish their technology goals because they “had to put 100% of their resources in the Y2K problem.” Most software and application companies came out with Y2K-compliant operating systems to solve the four-digit date problem."
Companies around the world spent billions of dollars to go through their entire application source code to look for the Y2K bug and fix it.
"Finally, the big day arrived—and nothing horrific occurred."
"Banks moved money, the IRS collected taxes, and planes flew."
(I [Peter] was so concerned that I stayed up past midnight just to check my firm’s financial data.)
Everything was fine.
"People had promised so many problems that, when none occurred, some people were disappointed."
Promising problems is a safe strategy for leaders because rarely does a significant initiative go exactly as planned.
"When you only sell the positives of your plan, and complications arise, employees have a tendency to say, “I told you so.”
Instead, you should say something like, “We have a great plan, but I know there are potentially serious problems to correct along the way."
What I am most excited about when I think about these potential problems is that we have a team of experts assigned to this project.
"If anyone can fix big problems, the people on this team can.”
“Success is never final."
Failure is never fatal.
"Courage is what counts.”
—Winston Churchill
Key #3: Select the Right People for the Right Job
Best-of-the-Best organizations received an outstanding 80-percent agreement from their employees that the company hired the most qualified candidates for jobs."
"Not only are the best people hired and promoted, but they are also well trained so they can perform at the same level as other high-achieving employees."
"An employer of choice has the ability to recruit and retain high performers, and much of an employee’s satisfaction depends on the actions of his or her supervisor."
"Strategy 19: Hire the Best People You Can Find
Kevin and Jackie Freiberg printed T-shirts that read “HIRE PEOPLE WHO DON’T SUCK.” Though we don’t intend to, we have all hired such people."
"Such people bring a bad attitude, complete assignments late, do not care about the quality of their work, lack accountability, and, if that is not enough, tell everyone in the organization you are a lousy leader."
"When they walk out the door for the last time, their absence actually brightens up the office."
"Southwest Airlines’ former CEO Herb Kelleher said, “We hire for attitude and then teach the skill.”3 If you have ever flown on a Southwest flight, you recognize that Kelleher knows the importance of the right attitude."
"Employees can usually improve upon their skills, but attitudes are harder to change."
"Recently, we were both on a Southwest flight from San Diego to Phoenix."
"After take-off, the pilot said over the intercom, “We are happy you have chosen to fly with us on Southwest Airlines today."
"To make your flight as enjoyable as possible, we have a fine crew who will serve you."
"At Southwest, the pilot and first officer go to a large room each morning and hand-select the finest flight attendants in the industry."
"Unfortunately, this morning the first officer and I overslept and arrived at the selection room a little late."
"Monica, Robin, and Shawn were the last three attendants available and we had to pick ’em."
"We hope you will be kind to them and enjoy the flight.”
When we landed, the landing was a little bumpy and hard."
"Shawn, one of the flight attendants, announced over the intercom, “That abrupt landing was not the pilot’s fault.” Robin, the second flight attendant, came over the intercom and said, “And that abrupt landing was not the first officer’s fault.” Monica, the third flight attendant, spoke into the intercom and said, “That abrupt landing was the asphalt."
"Welcome to Phoenix.” It was so obvious this crew had fun flying together, which made a rather dull flight to Phoenix in a full cattle car a ton of fun!"
“People are definitely a company’s greatest asset.
It doesn’t make any difference whether the product is cars or cosmetics.
"A company is only as good as the people it keeps.”
—Mary Kay Ash


Strategy 20: Know the Needs and Goals of Your Employees
President Lyndon Johnson was adept at building and maintaining personal connections with just about every individual he met in his personal and private life."
He was a great communicator who didn’t shy away from making connections.
He took time to listen to the goals and needs of others.
"He was brilliant in the art of human relations, and in 1960, he found himself heading to the White House as vice president with John F. Kennedy."
"If you want highly motivated employees, recognize their personal and professional needs and goals."
Most managers are so focused on telling people what needs to be done that they have little time to get to know their employees.
"So ask these seven questions to help you understand your employees:
1."
Who’s the best boss you have ever had?
2.
Who’s the worst boss you have ever had?
3.
Why have you resigned from jobs?
4.
What parts of your job lessen your productivity?
5.
What specifically do I do that lessens your productivity?
6.
"What aspects of your job excite, challenge, or motivate you, or make you feel proud of your accomplishments?"
7.
What can I do better to help you accomplish your goals?
"Although asking these questions takes time, along with a genuine interest in listening to answers, engaged employees are more productive, stay with you longer, and are much more willing to do whatever it takes to make you—as a leader—and your organization successful."
“The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood.
"The best way to understand people is to listen to them.”
—Ralph Nichols
Strategy 21: Ensure Each Employee Has Goals That Align With the Department, Division, and Organization
One of the significant keys to creating workplace excellence is ensuring that every employee knows what specific goals he or she needs


to accomplish to achieve the organization’s vision."
It has been our experience that employees who are clear on their goals are motivated to successfully achieve them.
There are a variety of reasons to set employee goals.
"They focus employees on the purpose of the business, which enhances the chances of your organization’s long- and short-term success."
Goals also provide purpose to your organization’s appraisal and/or bonus program.
"To be successful, employee objectives must be concrete, attainable, and critical to the growth of your business."
They must also be set with employee involvement.
"As silly as it sounds, many managers determine their budget and set goals for their team by themselves."
Setting goals without the involvement of the employee who is responsible for the goal is not good leadership.
"When you set goals for other people and ram them down their throats, the goals are usually rejected and hurled back in your direction with excuses about why they are not applicable or appropriate in the specific situation."
"Employees are often the best source for information about what job-specific goals will contribute to overall increased productivity, responsiveness, or other business goals."
Involving employees also eliminates the potential for the resentment that can arise when goals are imposed.
Legendary Penn State football coach Joe Paterno is known to be a hard-nosed leader who sets high goals for his players and accepts nothing short of perfection in the achievement of them.
"Yet, his ability to give credit to team members who work well together and lead the team to victory explains why so many high school students dream of playing for him someday."
"Coach Paterno has coached more than 25 fathers and, subsequently, their sons."
“Give me a stock clerk with a goal and I’ll give you a man who will make history.
"Give me a man with no goals and I’ll give you a stock clerk.”

Strategy 22: Support a Meaningful Work-Life Balance
Terry Paulson, CSP, CPAE, is an author, motivational speaker, and past president of the National Speakers Association."
"Terry encourages participants in his programs to write down the “keepers.”


“Keepers” to Terry are the things you learn from others that would be valuable if you incorporated them into your life."
One of the “keepers” I (Peter) have learned from Terry is to buy tickets.
"If you do, you almost always take the time off from work or your normal everyday routine to use them."
"Ever since I heard Terry share this, I have planned our vacations at least six months in advance by buying tickets."
Make a list of all the places you would like to see in your lifetime.
"Make another list of all the events, such as sporting events, concerts, or plays, you want to see."
The next step is easy: just buy tickets.
"Go online, and in a very short time, you can buy your tickets for the entire year."
Book the cruise.
Plan the road trip.
Arrange the flights and reserve the hotel.
I like to pay for the trip in advance.
"The more commitment I make to the trip or event, the better the chances are that nothing will get in the way of taking time off with my family."
"You can also plan less-expensive events in advance, such as going to a play or making reservations for dinner."
"It is important that you support your staff to maintain a balance between their work and their private lives, too."
Encourage your team members to “buy tickets” and take the appropriate time off to use them.
"When team members come back from time off, it is fun to have them do a brief show-and-tell of what they did while they were away."
Workaholics are not doing their organizations or their families a favor.
They tend to be bad at delegating tasks and mentoring others to build organizational capacity.
Go buy some tickets!
“Sometimes it’s important to work for that pot of gold.
"But other times it’s essential to take time off and to make sure that your most important decision in the day simply consists of choosing which color to slide down on the rainbow.”
—Douglas Pagels
Strategy 23: Breathe Life Into Your Company With New Blood
Diversity has long been linked to a team’s success."
"The reasoning behind this conviction is that diverse viewpoints can ultimately lead to better solutions, which, in turn, can lead to greater success."
Does this conventional wisdom actually hold true?
"Researchers at Northwestern University set out to discover if diversity really does improve team


success."
"Their findings, as reported in Science, suggest that, although diversity is essential, issues such as race, age, gender, socio-economic status, and religion—which are what most of us think of when we hear the word diversity—are not the most critical factors in building team success.4
So what are the critical factors?"
"After comparing successful and unsuccessful teams, the Northwestern researchers reported two very revealing findings:
 Successful teams had a mixture of experienced people and
newcomers to the field."
" Successful teams had a few seasoned veterans who had
never worked together prior to joining the team."
"This second finding is interesting, because people who are tested veterans in a field often have a reputation for carrying huge egos, and big egos usually do not work well together."
So what makes a team great is bringing together seasoned veterans who have a strong desire to collaborate and learn from other seasoned veterans.
Every successful sports team is a carefully crafted mix of veteran as well as rookie players.
"Historically, credit unions would never hire someone with banking experience because credit unions market their very existence on “not being like a bank.” Banks, in contrast, have spent enormous sums of money challenging the nonprofit status of credit unions."
"Mike Maslak, CEO of North Island Credit Union, a large financial institution in San Diego County, knows the competitive value of bringing new blood into the organization."
Maslak broke credit union tradition and hired several veteran bankers to help expand North Island’s growth in the San Diego County financial markets.
The outcome for North Island has been profoundly positive.
A vital lesson here is that simply introducing new blood is not enough; it has to be the right new blood.
A careful screening process will enable you to find the perfect combination of types to transfuse new life into your business.
“People have a tendency to want to work with their friends— people they’ve worked with before.
"That is exactly the wrong thing to do.”
—Luis Amaral


Strategy 24: Cut the Anchors!"
"When it comes to making change in organizations, we believe there are three types of people: propellers, rudders, and anchors."
Propellers create positive energy that can help you maneuver in the direction of your vision.
Rudders hang off the back of the boat.
They neither propel you forward nor inhibit your ability to move.
"Given a little positive en- ergy and clear direction, they will help guide you where you need to go."
Then there are anchors.
Twice in my life I (Peter) have owned a boat.
"One time when I tried to leave, the anchor was stuck in the mud."
Three of us went up to the front of the boat and tried in unison to pull the anchor out.
"Even with the help of the electric winch, we were not able to free the anchor."
"After about 20 minutes, one of my friends said, “Why don’t we just cut the anchor?” My response was, “No way!"
"I have sunk so much money into this, there is no way I am going to cut the anchor."
"If it went down, it has to come up.” We even tried turning the boat around and pulling the anchor out with the power of the engines."
"Finally, I conceded and gave the order: “Cut the anchor!” Once the anchor was cut, we were able to move in the desired direction."
"If “anchors” in your organization are unwilling to change after you have spent time coaching, counseling, and training them, then cut them loose and share them with a competitor."
"Instead of spending too much time with an “anchor,” you should focus on developing personnel willing to adapt to an ever-changing business climate."
"Release one or two change-resisters, and the rest of the team will quickly say, “I can learn and I can change.”


Tact is critical."
"Terminating anchors before you communicate clear expectations, as well as provide coaching and training, can induce fear in your organization."
"The problem with fear in organizations is that your best employees, not the anchors, will be the first to leave."
"If terminating anchors becomes necessary, use carefully planned maneuvers."
“It’s not that some people have willpower and some don’t.
"It’s that some people are ready to change and others are not.”
—James Gordon, MD
Strategy 25: Formally Introduce New Hires to the Company or Division
For more than 25 years, Anthony Robbins’s seminars, videos, and audio recordings focused on personal development have helped nearly 50 million people."
"The Anthony Robbins Companies, located in San Diego, California, employ more than 200 people."
"Each quarter, at the all-employee meeting, the senior management team reviews company successes and opportunities, communicates strategic goals, and reviews actions brought about from the employee opinion survey."
"At these quarterly meetings, each new employee is introduced so everyone knows who the person is and where he or she will be working in the organization."
Many organizations we work with do this first step.
What happens next is most impressive.
Senior managers tell the new hires that the team works hard to create a place where employees love to work and they strive hard to hire the best employees to work in this environment.
"Then they add, “When you strive to hire the best, we know you have a choice where you work."
We want to hear from you why you chose to work for the Anthony Robbins Companies.” Each new employee then shares the reason.
It is obvious that four things are accomplished by this.
"First, all employees are reminded that the company seeks to hire the best."
"Second, everyone is able to see who has recently joined the team."
"Third, new hires feel important and valued by being introduced."
"Last, when all employees hear the reasons new hires decided to join the company—most of which center around the opportunity to grow or work for a company that is focused on helping others—the overall spirit of everyone is raised."
"If your organization or team does not formally introduce new team members, we encourage you to do so—but don’t stop there."
Tell your new hires you know they have a choice where they work and you want other team members to hear why they chose your company.
"“People first, then money, then things.”
—Suze Orman


Strategy 26: Pay People a Competitive Wage for the Job They Do At a large technology company with affiliate offices throughout the United States, an engineer started off the interview by stating, “I feel like I have just been kicked in the privates.” When we inquired about what had happened, the engineer responded, “I hate hiring engineers into our company because new people off the street are demanding almost 20 percent more as a starting salary than our top-performing engineers, who have been with us over 10 years, are currently compensated."
"And, to add insult to injury, we are asking our veteran top-performing engineers to train these new hires who walk in the door making more money."
"It is not fair, and the joke in the engineering department is that you need to quit, go to work for another company, and reapply in a
year."
"Then you will be paid what you are worth.”
We recommend that organizations do a salary survey once every 18 months to two years."
Communicate the overall results to the employees who are impacted by the survey.
"If you are not able to confidently explain the objectivity of your survey, then employees tend to utilize Websites like monster.com and craigslist.org to gain salary data and believe it as the gospel truth."
"“I don’t pay good wages because I have a lot of money; I have a lot of money because I pay good wages.”
—Robert Bosch
Strategy 27: Show Employees Where the Money Goes
Employees see how much their organization charges a client for their products and services."
"In interviews, we have had employees tell us, “With what this company charges our customers, you know they should pay us more.”
Why not open the books and show employees exactly where the money goes?"
"If you charge a client $1,200 for your service, it is easy to show this breakdown."
"(See page 135)
Now, employees still might think that, at $86.50 net profit, the company is not sharing enough money."
"However, it is a much more realistic figure to float in their minds than $1,200 of gross revenue."
Show employees where the money goes.
"“The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend.”

Key #4: Remember: We’re on the Same Team
Each person in the organization needs to see the company’s vision."
Yet it will be very difficult to reach organizational goals if everyone acts on that vision independently.
Teamwork means everyone works together.
"In Best-of-the-Best organizations, 92 percent of employees firmly state that their companies place a high value on teamwork."
This value is put into action because 89.9 percent of Best-of-the-Best staff also say their department works well as a team.
"As a leader, creating an environment of teamwork is one of your most significant contributions."
"Strategy 28: Ensure That You’re Loyal to the Right Team
To create workplace excellence, collaboration and teamwork must be both demanded and rewarded."
"In a January 2006 poll conducted by the Center for Creative Leadership, 275 participants were asked if they saw the challenges faced by leaders today as more complex than the ones faced by lead- ers five years ago."
Ninety-three percent of the respondents agreed that the challenges today are more complex.
"More than 75 percent of the respondents went on to elaborate that these complex changes dictated that leaders in their organizations work more collaboratively, improve work processes, and participate in more cross-departmental teamwork."
Many senior and middle-level managers get confused when it comes to deciding which team deserves their true loyalty.
They attend executive team meetings to discuss things such as vision and strategic goals.
"As some executives and managers discuss these strategic goals with the management team, their spoken or unspoken conversations focus on protecting their true loyalty, which is their own department."
"At one strategic planning retreat we led, everyone on the executive team agreed that the
information technology department was not meeting the overall technology needs and vision of the organization."
"It was obvious that new leadership, new team members, or a new organizational structure was needed in the department."
"The CTO finally spoke up and said, “I don’t think I disagree with what the team is saying."
"But I need you to


know, my department will rebel and some team members will probably quit if we make the changes we are discussing here today.” Although it was fair for the CTO to point out the issues at stake, the job of senior managers is to make decisions that benefit the organization, not to placate individuals."
"When executives and/or managers speak poorly about the management teams they work with, they clearly demonstrate a lack of loyalty."
Even worse are the managers who say bad things about their bosses.
Speaking poorly about peers or about executive meetings is divisive to the organization and demonstrates to everyone that loyalty is both misdirected and biased.
"In each of these examples, managers are indirectly saying that they hold a stronger loyalty to their own team."
A house divided will not stand.
"If executives and managers are not on the same page with a common vision and goals, the only people who take advantage and become successful in these situations are the competitors."
"“When we are debating an issue, loyalty means giving me your honest opinion, whether you think I’ll like it or not."
"Disagreement, at this stage, stimulates me."
"But once a decision has been made, the debate ends."
"From that point on, loyalty means executing the decision as if it was your own.”
—Colin Powell
Strategy 29: Meet Regularly and Often
One of the greatest tricks played on leaders is listening to employees or peers who tell them, “We don’t need to meet.” The leader, wanting to be liked, honors the wishes of his employees and peers and cancels the meeting."
"It has been our experience that teams who are in conflict, or cannot come to agreement on goals or come to consensus to resolve problems, prefer not to meet."
"As a leader, it is important that you do not fall for the “we don’t need to meet” trick."
"When there are problems or conflicts in your team or in your organization, you need to meet more often until the conflicts are resolved."
We are the first to agree that some meetings are a total waste of everyone’s time.
"By some estimates, at least half of a manager’s time is spent in some form of meetings."
"At the most senior level of organizations, leaders may spend up to 85 or 90 percent of their work


time in meetings."
"It is not uncommon for managers and employees to describe some or all of the meetings they attend as a complete waste of their time, but it is important to note that meetings are only a waste of time when the wrong people are in attendance or the right people are missing."
"As a leader, schedule a regular meeting for your team/organization."
Choose how often your team needs to meet and then delegate the responsibility of setting the day and time to someone else on your team to ensure the get-together happens.
"Productive meetings tend to occur more often, but for shorter periods of time."
The goal of the meeting is to ensure everyone on the team is on the same page and people are heading toward a common goal.
"Some of the topics that can be discussed at a daily, weekly, or monthly meeting include:
 Reviewing goals accomplished since the last meeting."
 Reviewing goal alignment between the organization and your department.
 Solving current challenges or opportunities for improvement.
 Updating team members on an individual’s progress.
 Resolving problems and/or conflicts.
 Creating goals and plans for the following week/month.
 Bringing up new information that will impact the team in the future.
 Recognizing team and individual team member success.
"To ensure that the meeting is a success, the following guidelines will help to make a productive meeting:
 Create an agenda."
 Ensure that team members have input into building the agenda.
 Hold team members accountable to staying focused on the agenda topic.
 Start and stop on time.
 Reward team members who are prepared.
 Coach and counsel team members who are not prepared or do not participate.
 Follow up by putting the action items into meeting notes and e-mail them to all participants.
 Follow up on action items so team members are prepared for the next meeting.
Don’t get tricked.
"Meet often and be recognized as a leader who leads successful, highly productive meetings."
"“If I am to speak ten minutes, I need a week for preparation; if fifteen minutes, three days; if half an hour, two days; if an hour, I am ready now.”
—Woodrow Wilson
Strategy 30: Let Out the Crawdads
In conducting interviews with government employees in one fed- eral agency, we quickly realized that their morale and spirit may be the worst of any team we have ever partnered with in our combined 30 years of consulting."
"Interestingly, more than 80 percent of the leaders in this division are eligible for retirement within the next five years."
"In reality, some had already mentally retired from their job years ago and were anxiously waiting for a formal date of physical separation."
"In the middle of an interview, one participant said, “Here is the best way to describe our division: We are just like a bucket full of craw- dads.” Unfamiliar with the analogy, we asked him to explain."
He went on: “I am from Louisiana.
"When you go crawdad fishing, there is an old saying, ‘You don’t need a lid for a bucket of crawdads,’ because as soon as one crawdad rises to the top of the bucket, another crawdad grabs him and pulls him back into the bucket."
That is the way we work around here.
"If one person gets excited about a change or something new, the rest of us grab her and drag her back down into the reality of working with the federal government, where nothing will ever change.”
Every organization has crawdads."
"Although crawdads make good eating when you visit Louisiana, they are not good team members."
"Crawdads—team members who suck the life out of others and destroy


the team morale and spirit—need to (1) change their attitudes or (2) leave the team."
"As a leader, it is your job to ensure that one of these two actions materializes in a short period of time."
"“I cannot say whether things will get better if we change; what I can say is they must change if they are to get better.”
—Georg C. Lichtenberg
Strategy 31: Aim, Don’t Blame
To encourage creative problem-solving, it is important to resist the temptation to assign blame when a problem is identified."
"Blaming others poisons the atmosphere; people defend their actions, which, in turn, limits their creativity as well as their risk-taking efforts when attempting to solve the problem."
"Any time an organization or department concentrates on “the blame,” people focus on covering their assets."
Uncovering and resolving problems always takes longer.
"Organizations and managers who undermine workplace excellence by assigning blame ask these two questions: “What went wrong?” and “Who is to blame?”
It is much more productive to focus the conversation on the future by asking the following two questions: “Where do we want to be?” and “How do we get there?” Engaged employees will respond by asking a third question: “How can I help?”
If you have ever been in a meeting that turned into a gripe session about something or someone, then you know what a blaming discussion sounds like."
"When discussions focus on who is at fault, nothing is accomplished."
"As long as someone or something can be blamed, no one needs to be personally accountable until that someone or something being talked about is “fixed.”
We recommend letting the blame discussion go on for about three to five minutes and then asking this question: “If we keep this discussion going in this direction, what will we accomplish?” Almost always, a team member will say, “Nothing.”
Placing 100 percent of your energy and focus on where you want to end up, and building a plan to get there, is a key to taking the necessary responsibility to make things happen."
"Playing a part in the blame game wastes your time, decreases productivity, and has the potential to cause negative financial impacts as a result of those decreases in productivity."
We consider the blame game akin to rolling a snowball down a steep hill and observing the boulder-sized result that is produced toward the bottom of the hill.
“All blame is a waste of time.
"No matter how much fault you find with another, and regardless of how much you blame him, it will not change you."
The only thing blame does is to keep the focus off you when you are looking for external reasons to explain your unhappiness or frustration.
"You may succeed in making another feel guilty about something by blaming him, but you won’t succeed in changing whatever it is about you that is making you unhappy.”
—Wayne Dyer
Strategy 32: Value Diversity
Most times when you hear the word diversity, people are referring to race, gender, age, or religion."
"Yet we have seen people of the same race, gender, age, and religion with zero tolerance for how others go about conducting business."
We also include social or behavioral style under the diversity umbrella.
"In our own consulting office several years ago, one employee came into my (Peter’s) office and wanted to fire our newest team member because of that person’s strong need to ask a lot of questions, and focus on the process of how and why we do things."
"The person who was asking me to terminate this employee was fast-paced and results-oriented, and didn’t feel a need for questions or process."
One of the big reasons we hired the new employee was her style of conducting business; it was so different from that of everyone else on the team.
"To slow us down, ask questions, and deliver a perfect product or project was exactly what our team needed."
"About six months, later the high-flyer came into my office to tell me she felt that our newest employee helped make a great team."
"We believe that by truly valuing diversity, you demonstrate actions that show respect and appreciation for peoples’ differences."
3M is one of the best corporations for clearly articulating the value they place on diversity.
"Their motto is “Diversity inside = more opportunity outside.”
For many people, diversity is about doing the legally right thing."
(Most organizations want to avoid being sued.)
"Organizations that truly value variety as a competitive weapon operate at a level that is


even higher than valuing diversity to remain in legal compliance."
"A workplace that demonstrates an active interest in workers as people first, then employees, can attract and retain a superior workforce."
"“When two men in business always agree, one of them is unnecessary.”
—William Wrigley, Jr.
Strategy 33: Have a Sense of Humor
To be a great team player, it helps to have a sense of humor."
Humor facilitates communication and builds relationships in the workplace.
"In more than 20 years of providing executive coaching services, we estimate that less than 10 percent of executives who are fired lose their jobs because of technical incompetence."
The other 90 percent are let go for their inability to either build a cohesive team or get along with others.
Humor and laughter help to relieve stress in organizations.
"In fact, it is impossible to feel stress, humor, and laughter all at the same time."
"Good humor that is supported with jokes, stories, anecdotes, and metaphors helps people to feel good, bond with the person delivering the message, and connect with the organization."
"In June 1990, Barbara Bush, wife of former President George
H. Bush, was asked to give the commencement speech at Wellesley College."
Some students protested the selection of Mrs. Bush as the speaker because they thought that she did not represent the type of independent woman Wellesley sought to graduate.
"Because Mrs. Bush had only one paying job in the early part of her adult years, the disgruntled students felt that Mrs. Bush’s success was a result of her husband’s position rather than her own work."
"Barbara received an enthusiastic welcome and delighted her audience by concluding her speech with the prediction that someone in the graduating class might someday follow in her footsteps as the president’s spouse—“and I wish him well.”
Great leaders understand the power of humor and the influence it can have on those they lead."
"By understanding the opposition to her appearance at Wellesley, Barbara Bush was able to effectively use humor to build a bond with the audience."
“A person without a sense of humor is like a wagon without springs.
"It’s jolted by every pebble on the road.”
—Henry Ward Beecher
Strategy 34: Just Shut Up and Listen
On a recent flight to New York, I (Jane) was one of the last two people waiting for luggage at the baggage carousel."
"For whatever rea- son, my luggage did not make the flight."
"I watched as the other passen- ger became livid, rushed over to the lost baggage counter, and started screaming and swearing at the agent behind the counter."
"He told the agent, without mincing words, that he intended to sue the airline, the baggage handlers, the pilots, and her for losing his bags."
"With his final sentence, he nearly spit in her face: “Are you listening to me?”
Yolanda, the agent, answered him in a very soft spoken, yet genuine voice: “Sir, the time is 12:14 a.m. You need to know that, right now, there are only two people in this whole world who care about your lost luggage."
"It is important for you to understand that with the way you are speaking to me, one of the two is rapidly losing interest.”
Accurate information is a vital aspect of listening."
"But in the business of creating an environment where employees love coming to work, there is a second essential reason to listen."
Listening tells others that you care about them and you value their opinions.
"You can build an environment where people feel cared about and valued by using these five tips:
 Be motivated to listen."
"The more you can learn, the better off you will be."
" If you must speak, ask questions."
"By moving from broad to narrow questions, you will eventually acquire the information you need to make the best decisions."
 Be alert to nonverbal cues.
"Although it is critical to listen to what your counterpart says, it is equally important to understand the attitudes and motives behind what is being said."
 Let your counterpart speak first.
 Do not interrupt when your counterpart is speaking.
Interrupting a speaker is not good business.
"“So when you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.”
—Jiddu Krishnamurti
Strategy 35: To See the Whole Team, Get up in the Balcony
In 2005 and 2006, Steve Nash, point guard for the Phoenix Suns, became one of a handful of players in the National Basketball Association to win the coveted Maurice Podoloff Trophy as the NBA’s Most Valuable Player two years in a row."
"What is remarkable is that at 6 feet, 3 inches tall, Nash is one of the shortest players in the NBA."
Nash joined Hall of Famer Magic Johnson as the only point guard in league history to capture multiple MVP trophies.
He became one of only nine players to win the award in consecutive seasons.
"When Nash was awarded the 2006 award (50 years after the inaugural award was given in honor of the first commissioner of the NBA, Maurice Podoloff), Commissioner Stern said, “Steve Nash is a star, but what is most significant is that the four other players on his team all averaged double-digit points in every game."
"He makes other players even better.”
What helps Steve Nash lead his team to greatness is his ability to play hard while keeping the whole game situation in mind."
"When Nash runs down the court or sets up his move for the basket, it is as if he hovers in the balcony above the court."
Most players are so intensely involved in their own play that they are not aware of who is mismatched with a defender or who is open for a pass.
This is what makes Nash so difficult to defend.
"Just when you think he is going to pass the ball, which he is most accustomed to do, he keeps it and scores."
"Business team leaders need to be able to:
 Think tactically and get the job done."
 View the entire organization from a “bigger picture” perspective.
 Honor an organization’s history.
" Gain a strong perspective about the changes in the economy, environment, and their industry."
Great leaders need to have the ability to move back and forth between the tactical sides of their job and to set up a more global perspective.
"“What we see depends mainly on what we look for.”
—John Lubbock
Strategy 36: Honor People’s Time
One of the best ways you can tell people that you really care about them and value them is to honor their time."
We have worked with several executives who are certifiably addicted to their CrackBerrys.
We can be sitting in a one-on-one meeting with them and every 30 seconds they pull out their vibrating BlackBerry or Trio to read an e-mail.
"Worse, they look at us and say, “Just a minute,” as they respond to the latest message."
"This sends out a really strong signal that
their time, and the time of the person they are responding to, is more valuable than we are."
"And if they do it to us, they do it to others."
"Recently, a manager I (Peter) was meeting with began reading his e-mail."
"I said, “Let me guess."
"It is another opportunity to buy Viagra online.” Stunned, he looked at me and said, “No, but it is unimportant."
"I will respond later.”
Another amazing example of showing people
you don’t value their time is the person who does not turn off the cell phone while in a meeting."
"As if that is not enough of a problem, some people raise arrogance to a whole level by answering their phones in a meeting or seminar and then talking to the caller while the meeting is in progress."
"On one Sunday, someone in our church congregation answered his phone and started a conversation during the sermon."
"Still, that is not as weird as the people who use their cell phones in a public restroom."
"The other day, some guy in the stall next to me (Peter) said three times, “Hello."
Hello.
"Hello.” When I said, “Hello."
"How are you?” the next thing I heard was, “Can I call you back?"
"Some idiot in the stall next to me is trying to talk to me.”
Following are several suggested ways for you to send the signal to others in your organization that you do honor their time:


 Don’t answer your phone when you are meeting with another individual."
 Don’t read your e-mail when you are meeting with someone one-on-one or you are in a meeting.
" If you are going to be late for a meeting, call the person you have scheduled the meeting with, apologize, and let that person know you will be late."
Offer the opportunity to re-schedule the meeting at another convenient time.
 Be organized so you can give your staff the proper time to work on your projects.
" If the project is not a crisis, ask your staff or peers when they have time to meet with you."
 Thank people for giving you their time.
" When people need help, give them your time, or a time when you are available."
 Copy people on your e-mails or voice mails when you will ultimately need their support to complete the task.
"When you copy others on e-mails, notify them if you need them to take specific action."
"“Time is at once the most valuable and the most perishable of all our possessions.”
—John Randolph
Strategy 37: Go FISH and Have Fun!"
One sarcastic definition of work is “You’d rather be doing anything else.” It’s a shame to spend so much time at work and still view its drudgery as normal.
"Fortunately, the opposite is also true."
"To love what you do—and have fun doing it—makes
a job not seem like work."
"Interestingly, research has shown that employees with a sense of humor are perceived to do a better job because they are less rigid, more flexible, and less stressed out."
It’s definitely something to consider in every job interview.
"In addition to finding the right people, it helps to support an environment that is fun."
"In 2000, Stephen C. Lundin, PhD, Harry Paul, and John Christensen wrote a best-selling book called FISH!"
"(Hyperion, 2000)."
"The book profiled Seattle’s Pike Place Fish Market, where the workers joke with each other and their customers."
Fun is the operative action—the employees even throw fish to each other.
Any workplace can be enjoyable.
Having or not having fun at work is a choice that everyone makes.
"There are a few essential ingredients of an enjoyable atmosphere:
 Fun must be valued and regarded as an important part of the work environment."
 Fun must be a part of your everyday work.
 Fun must be planned.
Get your team together and let them create a calendar with “fun” events.
 Think funny!
"If you love humor, you will constantly be looking for opportunities to express yourself."
"Tim Fennell, general manager of the San Diego County Fair, one of the largest fairs in the United States, knows the importance of having fun."
Tim took four hours out of the organization’s strategic planning retreat to take the entire management team go-kart racing.
"The next morning, everyone on the team was talking about how much fun they had competing with each other and cheering for their teammates."
"To generate ideas on how to enjoy work time, a great resource is Dave Hemsath’s and Leslie Yerkes’s book 301 Ways to Have Fun at Work (Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc., 1997)."
"“The supreme accomplishment is to blur the line between work and play.”
—Arnold Toynbee
Strategy 38: Do Something Significant for Your Community
People like to get behind a good cause."
"Helping a community organization imparts a wonderful feeling that MasterCard would describe as “priceless.” Whether it is a team running in a 10K or taking a 60-mile, three-day walk, the time spent together on a cause builds unity and teamwork."
It also shows the compassion and heart that are alive in the organization.
One great example of this was when we conducted a two-day retreat with Wells Fargo Mortgage Resources.
"At the end of the first day, we all boarded a bus and headed to a homeless shelter in the poorest section of downtown San Diego."
This shelter’s clientele was homeless women with young children.
"Kathleen Vaughan, senior vice president, and her team of leaders helped get dinner ready, made up the beds for the evening, read books to the children, and did a lot of talking about life with the moms."
Seeing kids without a home is heart-wrenching.
This experience was profound for us as consultants and as parents.
Kids are incredibly resilient.
There was not one child who was sitting on a pity pot because of spending a night in a shelter.
"These kids were happy, healthy, and overjoyed to have someone read a book or sing songs with them."
"As consultants, we saw that the teamwork, which was good on day one, was significantly enhanced on day two because of the team-building experience that had occurred at the homeless shelter the night before."
"We observed that everyone on the team had a huge heart and felt really good about giving back to the community and being able to make someone else’s life better, if only for one night."
"“Think of giving not as a duty but as a privilege.”
—John D. Rockefeller, Jr.

Key #5: Cool Stuff—Continuous Improvement and Innovation
Innovation is one of the top-10 most significant differences between the organizations in the Best-of-the-Best Benchmark compared to those in the Overall Benchmark."
"Best-of-the-Best companies understand that innovation—and the accompanying improved quality, efficient business processes, and competitive position—results from harnessing and rewarding the talents of innovative people."
"According to 79.5 percent of the staff, Best-of-the-Best organizations expect innovative ideas, which is a likely reason why these companies are highly competitive."
"Better yet, 84.5 percent of employees feel that the Best-of-the-Best recognize the people who come up with innovations."
That’s a sure way to keep the original ideas—the cool stuff—flowing through the company and out to the customer.
"Strategy 39: Great Leaders Keep People Uncomfortable
Yes, great leaders keep their people uncomfortable."
"The more traditions and long-term employees your organization has, the more pressure employees put on managers not to change things quickly— to keep them comfortable."
A favorite line used by employees who work for organizations with a strong history of following traditional methods is “We are not opposed to change.
"We just don’t like fast change.” A second classic is “Not all change is good change.”
Both of these famous lines deserve comment."
"First, the people who say “We just don’t like fast change” exhibit behaviors that signal they don’t like any change."
"You could tell them six months in advance that their cubicle location was going to change, and they would resent the advance notice about as much as finding out on the same day they had to move."
"Second, everyone is in agreement that not all change is good change."
Traditionalists fail to acknowledge that improvement in organizations never occurs without change.
"In one organization we worked with, the information technology department had built a reputation of being non-responsive to employees’ and management’s needs."
The IT team members worked on projects they personally found interesting.
"And, to ensure they kept their jobs, they defended technologies that were no longer meeting the organization’s long-term goals."
"The vice president knew his department was not meeting the organization’s needs, but every time he tried to implement a change, team members rebelled."
"We should have changed the vice president’s title to “hostage.”
In another organization, a disgruntled employee approached us at the end of our seminar entitled “Surviving and Thriving Organizational Change” and said, “You have no right to tell our managers that it is their job to keep us uncomfortable.” She continued, “Managers in our company have no clue how stressful our jobs already are.” The real challenge for this employee was that she was caught between a rock and a hard place."
She did not like her job.
She was providing poor customer service while customers were raising the bar on the level of service they were demanding from vendors.
This story has a short ending: That employee was shared with a competitor.
We are being practical when we say that leaders who keep their people comfortable for longer than three to five years usually end up losing their jobs.
"This happens because every time they try to make a change, the team members resist because they do not like change."
"Instead of challenging the employees and holding them accountable to the adaptation, the leader backs off and allows the followers to assume their normal routine."
"Three to five years later, the department or team is so far out of sync with the rest of the world that the only thing to do is fire the leader."
This drastic action occurs because the leader does not have the relationship needed to implement even basic change with the employees.
Raise the bar.
Hold people accountable.
Speed up the pace of change to gain advantage over a competitor.
Great leaders keep their people uncomfortable and unsatisfied with complacency.
"“Do not let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.”
—John Wooden

Strategy 40: Innovate and Outperform Your Competition
In 2006, the Boston Consulting Group analyzed the top-25 most innovative companies to see if they had a more profitable bottom line."
"The research, conducted for BusinessWeek magazine using data generated from Standard and Poor’s (S&P) Compustat, demonstrated that it pays to be an organization with a reputation for innovation."
"The innovators achieved a profit margin growth of 3.4 percent a year since 1995, compared with 0.4 percent for the median Standard and Poor’s Global 1200 company."
"The innovative companies’ median annual stock return was 14.3 percent, which was 3-percent higher than the S&P 1200 over the decade.5
The key to success is to pair innovative mentors with people who have a high potential to be innovative, and then give these individuals ample opportunities to practice."
Employees love to work for organizations that strive to improve by working on cool stuff.
"3M began its Carlton


Society, which consists of very successful innovators who serve as advi- sors throughout the company."
"Proctor and Gamble started Connect + Develop, a program designed to encourage “open innovation.” Apple Computer established its Apple Fellows project teams dedicated to innovation during the company’s startup years."
"Being committed to innovation and making that commitment clear to all members of an organization led to such accidental innovations as brandy, X-rays, peni- cillin, Silly Putty, potato chips, and microwave ovens."
"One of the best examples of corporate innovation is Netflix, the online mail-order DVD rental company."
"In 1999, Netflix decided it was more convenient to order DVDs online (with no due dates or late fees) than it was to drive to Blockbuster or Hollywood Video."
"By 2006, Netflix counted more than 7 million subscribers."
"In a re- cent seminar with 100 participants, we asked, “How many of you have gone to Blockbuster or Hollywood Video in the last month?” Eleven people raised their hands."
"We then asked, “How many subscribe to Netflix or another online service and received a DVD by mail during the last month?” Thirty-seven people raised their hands."
Even our 88-year-old father has 104 DVDs cued in his Netflix account.
Netflix’s award-winning customer service has allowed the company to outma- neuver Blockbuster and Hollywood Video because of its innovative approach.
"Then there is Sony, which was hesitant to release its digital music player until the company could ensure copyrighted music could not be illegally downloaded."
"Apple, with a very different goal, focused on creating technology to efficiently download, store, and play digital music."
The end result: The iPod made history.
"The corporate graveyard is full of organizations with a prescription for success, but who did not anticipate or produce the next product or service the consumer would need."
Innovate and outperform your competition.
"“Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.”
—Steve Jobs
Strategy 41: Personally Change First
Being a leader in an organization during these turbulent times is challenging and, occasionally, can seem like an overwhelming task."
"During the past 10 years, every organization has felt the impact of change through: rapid growth or downsizing, increased expenses and decreased profits, expanding or crumbling markets, more competition, and advanced technological demands."
"All are indicators that organizations will continue to face chal- lenges pushed by sharp economic swings, keen competitive pressures, globalization of the marketplace, and reshaping of businesses world- wide."
"Simply put, change is the reality and the organizations that refuse to acknowledge that reality will not survive what some have called “The Age of Instability.”
The most important distinction to remember is that organizations do not change."
It is the people who work for these organizations who do so—on an individual basis.
"When they do, they empower the or- ganizations to change."
"Unfortunately, it’s a given that not all employ- ees respond to altering the status quo with the attitude of “Fantastic!"
"Another organizational change and I’m excited to be a part of it!”
Strong-willed employees are like dinosaurs: They may be well on the path to extinction, but they will fight each step of the way."
"We have found that when change is introduced to an organization or, better yet, rumored, leaders will respond in one of three ways."
"First, some of the strongest-willed leaders will fight organizational change, even when deep down they recognize that the change is in the best interests of the organization."
The second type of leader takes a “let’s wait and watch” approach.
These leaders will not fight an organizational change because they do not think that it will directly impact them.
They dig their heels in deeply and hope that the change will eventually pass them by.
"Last, the third type of leader is able to accurately assess the future and possesses the flexibility to adapt accordingly."
"Typically, they are excited about changes and have anticipated the organization’s need to do so."
"As a leader, you are the role model."
The attitude you convey will be contagious.
"When leaders anticipate the need for change and get excited about role modeling the change, the dinosaurs either change or become extinct."
"“The most important thing is this: To be able at any moment to sacrifice what we are for what we could become.”
—Charles Dubois
Strategy 42: Be a Role Model for Leading the New Change
The only change that really exists is personal change."
"You can’t force people to change, but you can lead a change effort and be a role model for it."
"So, as a leader, what specific actions can you document that you altered over the last year?"
"If the leader does not change, you can tell team members they need to change, but most likely, it is not going to happen."
Try following these actions used by leaders who have helped pilot organizational change and improve workplace excellence.
Involve employees in the change process.
We are firm believers that employees are not so much against change as they are against being changed.
"It is incredibly important that you, as a leader, fully understand the meaning of the previous statement."
"The sooner you involve employees in the process, the better off you will be at implementing the change."
"Ask, don’t tell."
People who do not deal well with change are generally the same employees who cannot be “told” anything.
"For this reason, try asking them questions rather than stating why the changes are taking place."
Get both negative and positive informal leaders involved.
Most managers and supervisors involve the positive informal leaders in help- ing implement changes because they have a reputation for supporting management.
"The mistake is not getting the
negative informal leaders involved in the be- ginning stages of the change process."
"Because negative informal leaders are usually left out, they lack commitment and may even try to sabotage the change."
"By involving them, their behaviors will change."
"Besides, when you know what their objections and concerns are,
it will help you design your strategy."
"Finally, if you can meet their con- cerns, they will help sell the change to the rest of the organization."
Raise expectations.
"Although it may be more practical to expect less in terms of performance, this is the time to raise performance lev- els for both yourself and your employees."
"During change, employees are more likely to modify their work habits."
Seize the opportunity and push them to try harder and work smarter.
"Require performance im- provements and make the process challenging, but remember to keep goals realistic so you can eliminate the frustration and failure that ac- company an unfulfilled objective."
Ask employees for their commitment.
"Once the change has been announced, it is important that you personally ask for each employee’s commitment to successfully implement the change."
Over-communicate.
The change process usually means that normal communication channels in the firm won’t work as well as they usu- ally do.
"During this time, your employees will be hungrier than ever for information and answers."
You can “beef up” communication in two ways.
"First, offer employees an opportunity to give you input."
"Second, strive to clear up rumors and misinformation that clutter the communication changes."
Remember: It is almost impossible to over- communicate.
Stay positive.
Your attitude will be a major factor in determining what type of climate your employees feel.
"Change can be stressful and confusing, so try to remain upbeat, positive, and enthusiastic."
"During times of transition and change, compensate your employees for their extra effort."
Write a little note of encouragement and drop it on an employee’s desk.
Leave a nice message on someone’s voice mail.
E-mail a word of thanks or encouragement.
Take employees aside and tell them what a great job they are doing.
"Last, try to portray organizational change as a personal challenge."
"As football players look to their quarterback for guidance and inspiration on the field, your employees look to you for the same in the game of business."
"If the quarterback does not instill confidence in his teammates, the team’s offense suffers and victory becomes uncertain."
"With the increasing number of uncertainties that businesses face today, the future promises both challenges and opportunities."
"As a leader, it will be your responsibility to overcome the obstacles and succeed."
Will you lead your team to that end zone in the boardroom and on the balance sheet?
“A leader takes people where they want to go.
"A great leader takes people where they don’t necessarily want to go, but ought to be.”
—Rosalynn Carter
Strategy 43: Encourage and Reward Employees’ Ideas, Suggestions, and Recommendations
Many managers believe that they encourage employees to offer ideas, suggestions, and recommendations to improve the company."
Some employees do offer input.
"Other employees come in each day, do their work, and then leave."
"The latter come to work each day and, having done their job for so long, never have to think."
"Some disgruntled employees have even been quoted as stating, “They don’t pay me enough to think.” It is difficult to create workplace excellence unless everyone on the team thinks about what needs to be done, specifically what each individual can do, to improve the organization."
Best-of-the-Best organizations we survey not only encourage em- ployees to provide ideas and suggestions—they expect it.
"Then, they build this expectation into the performance management system so they can reward the employees who come up with the cool stuff."
"When employees are rewarded for innovation, they continue to innovate."
Encouragement is a great thing.
"Outlining expectations, then recognizing and rewarding people for meeting those expectations, is even better."
"“The spirited horse, which will try to win the race of its own accord, will run even faster if encouraged.”
—Ovid
Strategy 44: Change What You Reward
Does your organization need to change to be even more competitive in the marketplace?"
"If so, the fastest way is to also change what you reward."
"When you reward with the exact same thing you have for past years, you are most likely going to get the exact same result."
"Some years ago, one of the rites that followed passing the bar exam and becoming an attorney in a large law firm was being rewarded with a


personal secretary or paralegal."
"As law firms consolidated and worked on becoming more productive and profitable, people realized that with computers, it was no longer necessary to maintain a one-to-one attorney/secretary ratio."
"One secretary or paralegal, with the help of technology, could support two or three attorneys."
"If you want to see a war, take away an attorney’s personal secretary or paralegal."
"The secretary, the paralegal, and the attorney will fight to avoid sharing their human resources with another attorney."
This was a war that the secretaries were winning until the law firms changed what they rewarded.
"When the firms developed a bonus system that was based on productivity, change occurred rather quickly."
"These firms informed the secretaries and paralegals that if they were only able to handle the work of one attorney, they
would receive up to a 5-percent bonus."
"If they were able to handle the work of two attorneys, they would be eligible for a 10- to 15-percent bonus."
"Finally, a secretary or paralegal who was able to handle the work of three or four attorneys would be eligible for a bonus of 15 to 20 percent."
Another organization we worked with paid a commission on how many physicians were recruited into their HMO network.
The challenge to making the sale and earning a commission was that many of the recruiters negotiated outcomes with physicians who were not profitable to the company.
"When the company started a new hybrid system of paying the recruiters who considered both the sale and the profitability of the sale, behaviors quickly began to change."
"When you change what you reward, behaviors will follow."
"Although it is unfortunate that incentives too often drive human work ethic and boost results, not accepting this fundamental truth can be disastrous for your organization."
"“Start with good people, lay out the rules, communicate with your employees, motivate them, and reward them."
"If you do all those things effectively, you can’t miss.”
—Lee Iacocca


Strategy 45: Honor and Cherish the Past
Don’t put down or speak poorly about the way your team, your or- ganization, or your employees conducted their business in the past."
"In several executive-coaching sessions, leaders have shared that the very reason their employer hired them was because things were messed up and they were there to fix the problem."
These executives may be 100-percent accurate.
Most people do not get hired because every- thing is perfect.
"However, when you put down the past, you provoke divisive relationships where people quickly lose their motivation to fol- low you."
"Comments such as the following do nothing except destroy morale, even if they are true:
 “Our technology is antiquated."
"We need to get in line with the 21st century.”
 “Our processes and/or systems are broken.”
 “Our people are poor performers because they really believe they cannot be fired.”
 “Our people do not want to change.”
 “Because our people have worked so long for this company, they have no clue what goes on in other successful organizations.”
 “We are totally out of touch with the needs of our customers.”
There is another strong reason for not putting down your organization or your department’s past."
What already happened was good enough to invite you to join the team.
"A better strategy is to honor the past, and then communicate how your goals and actions can make the future even better."
It also helps to admit that you do not have all the answers and ask for the team’s help in finding them.
"The minute you put down a company’s history, there are always some employees thinking this thought: “I was here before you, and I will be here after you leave.” Many times, employees with this attitude orchestrate the undermining and removal of the manager who has been brought in to save the organization."
How can this be?
"If you put down the past, you destroy people’s self-esteem and morale."
People fight hard to maintain their dignity and self-esteem.
"Honoring and cherishing what went before, along with a game plan to work toward an even better future, builds teamwork and creates a motivated workforce devoted to helping, not undermining, the new leader."
"“You have to know the past to understand the present.”
—Dr."
"Carl Sagan

Key #6: Recognize and Reward Excellent Performance
Equally rewarding mediocre and excellent performances is a sure way to lower motivation and decrease morale."
"Best-of-the-Best organizations know this, so they exclusively reward above and beyond achievement."
Employees are well aware of this distinction; 73.4 percent of workers in Best-of-the-Best companies feel that the highest achievers are appropriately rewarded.
"According to 80.2 percent of their employees, those top-tier organizations also inform others of the individual’s success in order to encourage others to reach for the same levels of excellence."
"Strategy 46: Take Recognition off Your Things-to-Do List
We used to tell leaders that they needed to add the recognition of three people to their to-do list each day."
We were not picky about who our leaders recognized.
"It could be their direct reports, their boss, a peer, or even their spouse."
"As we’ve learned more about what employees value, we’ve altered our thinking about recognition."
"Cindy Ventrice, author of Make Their Day!"
"Employee Recognition That Works (Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc., 2009), states, “Take recognition off your things-to-do list."
Recognition isn’t something you can do and then check off your list.
"You need to think of recognition


a little differently."
Find ways to add recognition to every employee interaction.”6 What Ventrice is asking all of us to do is to make praise and recognition a part of everything we do in our lives.
Being grateful for individual contributions is an important step in creating engaged employees and workplace excellence.
"As a leader, recognizing people each day—and genuinely meaning what you say— forms relationships in which more people are willing to follow you and help you achieve the organization’s goals."
“Appreciate everything your associates do for the business.
"Nothing else can quite substitute for a few well-chosen, well- timed, sincere words of praise."
"They’re absolutely free and worth a fortune.”
—Sam Walton
Strategy 47: Planned, Spontaneous Recognition Works Best
We are big believers in planned, spontaneous recognition—and we are well aware that spontaneity isn’t planned and plans aren’t spontane- ous!"
Plan to make recognizing success a daily habit by looking around you at the work being performed.
"Instead of planning a formal award and announcing it, make your recognition more spontaneous."
"In a recent meeting, a vice president stood up and said, “No one knows what I am about to do, but it is always important to recognize great work.” He proceeded to call a manager up to the front of the room."
The manager was dumbfounded; she had no idea why she was being singled out.
"Then the vice president made the following speech: “In our values, we talk about exceeding customer expectations."
"In our values, we also talk about innovation."
"Over the last three weeks, I have received three phone calls or e-mails from clients praising the level of support they received from the customer support department."
Living that value alone is worthy of recognition.
But the reason I called Margaret up today is not only because her department is giving great service on a daily basis.
Margaret and two of her team members are actively involved in implementing a new Website for our customers.
I have seen a couple of additions to the Website and it is incredibly innovative.
"Some of the things Margaret and her team are working on I have never seen before, and I think they are going to give us a significant competitive advantage.”


The vice president ended his speech by shaking Margaret’s hand and telling her he knew how many extra hours she had been putting into this project."
Then he handed her a $200 check to take her family out for a meal on the company in recognition of her meaningful work.
It is important to note that things like bonuses and perks are not recognition.
We know one business owner with 15 employees who pays to have his employees’ cars detailed each week.
Another department manager buys lunch for her team one day each week.
"These are fabulous perks, but they are not recognition."
"Planned, spontaneous recognition works best when:
 What you are praising and why is crystal clear."
 Praise or recognition is specific.
 Praise is proportional to the accomplishment.
 Praise is timely.
"You will find that most employees respond well to public acknowledgement of their accomplishments, especially after they have placed a considerable amount of their time into the project."
It is critical you understand that by overindulging your entire workforce in benefits/ perks that they have not earned or cannot appreciate could produce a deadly complacency that would cripple your productivity.
"This is precisely why spontaneity is crucial to the provision of recognition, perks, and rewards."
"“Nothing is more effective than sincere, accurate praise, and nothing is more lame than a cookie-cutter compliment.”
—Bill Walsh
Strategy 48: Appropriately Reward the Highest Achievers
In an interview at a large, publicly traded, market-leading technol- ogy company located in San Diego, an engineering manager shared this story."
"Both the manager’s manager, a senior-level vice president, and a human resources manager agreed upon three things: One, the engineering manager was the most technically qualified in his division."
"Second, based on his starting salary and length of service, he was paid in the lowest quartile of the company’s salary scale."
"And finally, there was little hope of moving him to the top quartile because the company had a moratorium on wage increases."
The maximum increase a top-performing employee could achieve on this performance review cycle was 2 percent.
"When we asked this manager how much he felt he was underpaid, he responded, “Human resources has verified that I am about 30 percent below market, but there is nothing they can do about it because of this moratorium on wage increases.”
This disengaged manager and many other top performers in the or- ganization were dealing with their lack of appropriate compensation by withholding some discretionary effort."
"They made the conscious deci- sion to do what they had to do to get their job done, but nothing more."
The impact of not appropriately rewarding the highest achievers is that they start to question why they should go out of their way to work hard and produce extraordinary performance when there is no correlation between top performance and remuneration.
"As an organization, this is a scary situation."
"This technology company is relying on successful, extremely technical product launches over the next two years."
The people who are directly responsible for these new product introductions are contributing about 50-percent effort because they do not feel they are either competitively or appropriately compensated.
Evaluating people based on their performance is a wonderful concept.
"Assigning people to a specific pay scale, based on performance, is also a good idea."
"However, this organization and the executive committee missed providing the highest rewards to the top performers."
"When you only do one half of the compensation equation—defining what great performance looks like—but forget about the second half of the equation—compensating people for great performance—it is equivalent to telling people to win the race and when they do, tell them they did win, but give them a fourth-place medal."
"When you do not appropriately reward the maximum achievers, it is nearly impossible to create long-lasting workplace excellence."
"Today, the strategy of rewarding the highest achievers is being applied even in industries where traditionally everyone has been paid commensurately, regardless of performance, like education."
"On January 23, 2007, the Houston Independent School District (HISD) took a sizeable risk in the business of education by changing the teacher compensation model and paying a bonus to the teachers who


increased student test scores."
"Abelardo Saavedra, superintendent of the district, stated, “Today is really one of the most important days in HISD history.”7 The HISD school board set aside $14 million in 2007 for bonuses to reward top teachers and lure the top teachers from other school districts."
"Forty-two teachers received bonuses of $6,000 or more."
"The average teacher bonus was $1,800."
"As anyone familiar with the business of education would expect, the teachers unions are adamantly opposed to any pay system that would pay one teacher differently from another."
"Gayle Fallon, the president of the Houston Federation of Teachers, stated, “I think my members are all great teachers."
"This is one of the worst things I have seen done for HISD teacher morale.”8 A teacher, Lisa Auerbach, stated, “If you’ve got the money, then just give it to us in our salaries."
We go to work at 7.
"We come home around 4 or
5."
"Don’t make us jump through hoops.”9
The Best-of-the-Best know that it is critical to reward top performers for their results, even when everyone in the organization is not in agreement."
"“We will receive not what we idly wish for, but what we justly earn."
"Our rewards will always be in exact proportion to our service.”
—Earl Nightingale
Strategy 49: Find a Reason to Celebrate
One of our clients utilizes a clever form of celebration that started with one salesperson’s need to bring attention to his first big sale."
"When the salesperson made a sale worth more than $10,000, he stood up in his cubicle and honked a horn that had fallen off his son’s bicycle."
"The next day, another salesperson made a $10,000 sale, and he rang a bell from a child’s bicycle."
"When the second salesperson rang his bell, the first salesperson honked his horn to join in with the celebration."
"Today, every person on the floor keeps some type of noisemaker and joins the celebration when someone makes a significant sale."
One engineer with a warped sense of humor came out of his office to squeeze his whoopee cushion.
Even the president and the vice presidents come out of their offices to bang pots and pans or sound a trumpet.
What is exciting is that these celebrations are not restricted just to sales.
"Celebrations also take place when new employees are hired or start their first day at work, major projects are completed, and actual end- of-month results exceed the budget."
"We imagine that there are many leaders who are reading this right now and thinking, “Isn’t all this noisy celebration disruptive to an environment conducive for business?” For many organizations, this method of celebration would probably be disruptive because they do not place a high value on celebration."
"At this organization, the people on the team are incredibly supportive of each other and take pride in bringing attention to each other’s successes."
"Here, people look for a reason to sound their noisemakers."
"Knowing how to celebrate success, they enjoy it."
"“Celebrate what you want to see more of.”
—Tom Peters
Strategy 50: Honor Special Days
Everyone is so busy."
They don’t have time to spend celebrating someone’s birthday or a special occasion.
There are many people in the world who are only focused on achieving the goal and counting the money that drops to the bottom line.
"These types of people believe that subtracting time out of the day to recognize a special occasion wastes time, costs too much money, and is not all that necessary anyway."
Nothing could be further from the truth when it comes to creating workplace excellence.
The Western Growers Association carves time out of every employee meeting to honor noteworthy employee accomplishments and anniversary milestones.
"To call someone out of his or her office or cubicle into the conference room to sing and share cake on their special day—whether a birthday or 10-year anniversary with the company—is an easy way to say: “You are really important to us and the organization’s leaders support us in taking this quick time out to acknowledge you.”
In interviews, we hear this comment over and over: “We used to be like a family around here."
"We used to celebrate birthdays, but now we don’t do that anymore."
"I guess management doesn’t care about our people any longer.”


Many years ago, we consulted with American Residential Mortgage Corporation (AmRes), now an acquisition of the Chase Manhattan Corporation."
AmRes was the best at honoring employees on their spe- cial days.
"One day, I (Peter) was walking among the cubicles when I no- ticed one manager’s space had a bunch of balloons hung up all around it."
I went up to the manager and wished her a happy birthday.
"She replied, “It is not my birthday."
"Last night was my first date since my di- vorce was final and my entire team felt it was an occasion to celebrate.”
About two weeks later, I walked by her cubicle again and there was just one black balloon hanging up."
"When I asked the manager about it, she replied, “No, it was my second date and this guy was not a keeper.” Although this example may not fit with the culture in your organization, everyone at AmRes showed that they cared about each other."
"Honoring special days, whether a birthday, anniversary, new addition to the family, graduation, or promotion, tells people that they are special and valued."
"“The more you praise and celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate.”
—Oprah Winfrey
Strategy 51: Recognition Is Everyone’s Job
Many organizations believe that recognition is the job of human resources."
It is not!
"When organizations rely on that department to be the organization’s sole motivator, they fail."
"Recognition that comes out of human resources is usually generic, so it will not work everywhere in the organization."
Building an environment where everyone feels recognized and appreciated is everyone’s job.
"In Best-of-the-Best organizations, it is the job of human resources to:
 Measure the culture with an employee opinion survey and break out the results by department, branch, or location so every leader knows the reality of the culture in their area."
" Develop and make available different forms of recognition, such as toolkits that include articles on motivation and recognition, certificates that can be customized, gift certificates, gifts, or movie passes."
 Make sure managers are well-trained in the areas of leadership and supervision.
" Ensure managers have a working action plan, based on the results of the employee opinion survey, to create workplace excellence."
Making an effort to recognize someone’s uniqueness goes a long way.
All it takes is a brief note or phone call.
Here is an example of a note received by a social worker in a hospital: “Thank you for all the support you have given to the families of patients in our unit.
Your dedicated effort to ensure parents have their needs met gives us a lot more time to focus on the medical needs of the children.
"Your efforts are greatly appreciated.”
Peer recognition works because it increases the overall frequency of recognition."
"When the frequency of recognition increases, people feel better, and the environment becomes a much nicer place to work."
The persuasive “law of reciprocation” grabs hold and becomes a positive force in the organization.
We all have had the experience of a person not on our list sending us a holiday card or showing up at the front door with a holiday gift.
"The “law of reciprocation” states that if I do something nice for you, even as simple as sending you a greeting card, you will feel a powerful need to reciprocate."
The same law applies to the business of recognition and appreciation.
"If I recognize or show appreciation for some- thing you do, it increases the chances that you will return the apprecia- tion or recognition to me."
"It is important to note that you had better genuinely mean your recognition and appreciation, or the outcome will be worse than if you had not said anything to the recipient."
"When you don’t mean it, your recognition or appreciation will not have the in- tended impact, but, rather, will come across as manipulation."
"“Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are truly endless.”
—Mother Teresa


Strategy 52: Be Grateful for People Support
When you look up grateful on Dictionary.com, the word is defined as “appreciative of benefits received.” When employees know you value their contributions and are truly grateful for the difference they make to the organization’s success, they will ensure that great things happen."
"It does not matter if it is your boss, a direct report, or your significant other."
"When people feel valued, they are more motivated to help you achieve your goals."
The opposite of being grateful is not being appreciative for benefits received or taking people for granted.
"There are some managers who will say, “I do not take people for granted."
"I pay them well to show up and do their jobs, and that is what I expect them to do.” We are in total agreement with this last comment."
All employees who come to work are paid to show up and do their jobs.
"When you have this expectation, that is exactly what you get: disengaged people who show up and do exactly what you pay them to do."
"A leader who understands the importance of being grateful is Douglas R. Conant, CEO of the Campbell Soup Company."
"Since join- ing Campbell Soup in January 2001, Conant has sent more than 16,000 thank-you notes to employees at all levels of the organization."
Does being grateful help drive results?
We think it does.
"Since March 2003, Campbell Soup’s stock is up 100 percent, more than double the results of other comparable food companies.10
Be grateful for the contributions of each team member."
"One participant in a seminar asked, “Do I need to be grateful for the one employee on our team who causes me the most amount of grief?” Another participant responded, “Be grateful."
"If every employee on your team were perfect, the team would not need you.” So true!"
“Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life.
"It turns what we have into enough, and more."
"It turns denial into acceptance, chaos into order, confusion into clarity…."
"It turns problems into gifts, failures into success, the unexpected into perfect timing, and mistakes into important events."
"Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow.”
—Melodie Beattie


Strategy 53: Kill the “Employee of the Month” Award
This action is treading on sacred ground for many organizations, but we feel that the Employee of the Month, Employee of the Quarter, and Employee of the Year awards do more harm than good."
"That’s because most organizations do not set hard, objective criteria to determine who deserves the award."
"If companies stated objective criteria about exactly what it takes to win the award, there would be more than just one Employee of the Month."
Or the same individuals would win the award each consecutive month because their results would be consistently the closest to being in alignment with the award criteria.
This is like asking people to play a game while you make up the rules as you go.
"When people cannot figure out the rules to the game, they quickly lose interest in playing."
"At the end of one strategic planning retreat, the vice president of human resources said, “We need to pick this month’s Employee of the Month before we leave the retreat.” Another vice president responded, “We need to pick a man this month because the last three winners have all been women.” They finally selected a man who had not ever won the award."
"When the selection process relies on such subjectivity, it causes employees to ask questions such as these: “Exactly what do I need to do to become the Employee of the Month?"
"How is this month’s winner any better than I am, especially when I have accomplished things even more significant than the winner?"
"Am I not doing a good job?”
Another organization took great pride in the Manager of the Quarter award."
"They actually paid a bonus of $10,000 to the winner."
"One manager told me, “I hope I do not win the award."
"It has such a stigma of being the ‘kiss ass’ of the quarter versus someone who is truly the top-performing manager in the organization.” Imagine— $10,000 was not worth the stigma that was attached to a poorly designed award."
"We recommend offering planned, spontaneous recognition when employees in the organization do great things."
"There may be five employees this month worthy of recognition; next month, there might not be any."
"When employees can connect significance to the recognition, it is a lot more meaningful."
"“Don’t worry when you are not recognized, but strive to be worthy of recognition.”
—Abraham Lincoln


Key #7: Accountability Counts
It is virtually impossible to hold employees accountable for their performance if they are not clear on their performance expectations."
"According to 85.1 percent of employees at Best-of-the-Best organiza- tions, they work with clearly defined job descriptions."
Even more (92.5 percent) believe they have a clear understanding of the performance standards/measurements at the company.
Accountability for meeting the performance measures is delivered during performance reviews that help staff learn and improve—80.7 percent of employees at Best- of-the-Best organizations feel their reviews accomplish that—and through ongoing feedback throughout the year.
"Strategy 54: Demand Unwavering Commitment
We are all for honest communication from employees."
"As a leader, you should encourage employees to tell you what they like and don’t like about the organization and the department’s goals."
They should feel free to tell you when they believe you are wrong.
They can even provide feedback on your leadership skills so you can “turn up the volume” to be more effective.
"Once a decision is made for the organization or the team, then it is critical for your organization’s success to demand unwavering commit- ment."
"Although candid communication is important, exhibiting behav- iors that undermine the achievement of goals should not be tolerated."
What is amazing is how many leaders make excuses for their employees’ lack of commitment.
"Some of the excuses we hear are:
 The employee has worked for the organization for a long period of time."
 The employee does not like change.
 The employee does a good job on the other technical aspects of the job.
 The boss is too busy to deal with the situation.
 The boss does not like conflict.
 The boss hopes that the employee will improve.
"When you demand commitment, remember that unwavering mo- rale will usually decline before it can rise to an even higher level."
The reason that morale declines at first is because people do not like to be held accountable for a commitment to which they lack desire or agree- ment.
"If you stay the course and hold fast to your
desire for commitment, eventually the behaviors will change and become aligned with the goals."
"When there is alignment of goals, results improve."
"When results improve, morale improves."
Demanding unwavering commitment to the organization’s goals is not easy.
The alternative is even more difficult.
"When employees do not ex- hibit the behaviors that actively demonstrate their support for the team’s or organization’s goals, they undermine workplace excellence."
"The lack of sup- port for the goals undermines morale, as well as your success as a leader, and lengthens the amount of time it takes to accomplish the goals."
“There’s a difference between interest and commitment.
"When you’re interested in doing something, you do it only when it’s convenient."
"When you’re committed to something, you accept no excuses, only results.”
—Ken Blanchard
Strategy 55: Measure Hard Results
For the first few years of our consulting business, we focused on the soft side of leadership."
"In other words, we placed a high value on how people felt about their work experience."
Our secondary focus was on the results that the organization achieved.
This was a mistake.
"Based on our employee opinion survey benchmarks that contain more than 100,000 employees, Best-of-the-Best companies taught us valuable leadership lessons: Focus on the hard, tangible results."
"Measure the hard, tangible results."
"Reward people for successfully achieving the hard, tangible results."
"When the hard, tangible results meet or exceed expectations, morale takes care of itself."
"Best-of-the-Best organizations score more than 15 points higher than organizations in the Overall Benchmark in the hard, tangible areas of:
 Clarity of mission and vision."
 Clarity of strategic direction.
 Clarity of the organization’s strategic goals.
 Employees knowing exactly what goals they are responsible for achieving.
 Holding employees accountable to defined performance standards.
"“An ounce of performance is worth pounds of promises.”
—Mae West
Strategy 56: Be Fair: Hold Everyone Accountable for Results
There is a big problem when your organization’s culture is based on politics and who you know instead of a reputation for recognizing the performance of each employee."
Many of us have worked in an organization where a coworker is worthless when it comes to serving and supporting others in the organization.
"This person should be fired, but someone in power in the organization, for whatever reason, protects the worthless wonder."
"Each year, we do a 360-degree evaluation on each of our team members."
"One year, I (Jane) rated one of our employees a 5 out of 5 when it came to the area of teamwork."
"When I looked at the results of her 360-degree, the staff had rated her a 2 out of a possible 5."
"When I talked with the staff, I told them I was surprised because I thought this employee was a 5."
"One staff member responded, “She is a 5 to you and Peter."
To everyone else she is a 1 or a 2.” That frank feedback helped our team refine our performance review process to break the rating on teamwork into two questions.
One question focused on teamwork and support to the senior consultants.
The second question was focused on rating teamwork and support to fellow members of the staff.
"When people are not held equally accountable for producing re- sults, employees do not perceive the manager or the organization as being fair."
"Many times, managers tell us they do hold everyone ac- countable."
"Still, not all employees know what managers do one-on-one


with employees to ensure accountability."
"This may be true, but it might not matter."
The only things employees are able to observe and form an opinion on regarding accountability is the outcome or results of each employee’s behavior.
"When you begin to hold employees accountable, it is important to remember that morale may go down before it rises to a higher level."
We call this riding the “J” curve of workplace excellence.
"When you start on the accountability trail, some employees may become resentful."
"If you are a new leader to a team, you know what this feels like."
The employee wants to tell you something like this: “I liked my old boss a lot better.
My old boss did not bug me and I didn’t bug her.
"You annoy me, and I would be a whole lot happier if you would just leave me alone.”

The J-Curve









Current Performance Level

Morale Improves Over time, higher expectations and
accountability will
lead to improved results, driving even higher levels of morale."
"Morale Declines
When accountability and expectations for improved performance are increased, morale initially declines."
"When you start to hold employees like this accountable, they, along with every other marginal employee, become disgruntled."
Morale declines and starts to move toward the bottom of the “J” curve.
The morale and motivation must go down to the starting point on the “J” before it can rise up to the top.
Being a great leader in search of the path that leads to workplace excellence is not for the faint of heart.
Holding all employees accountable to clearly defined outcomes is hard work.
"With really difficult employees, it feels like a fight."
Yet holding everyone accountable and holding onto the “J” for the entire ride takes you one step closer to creating workplace excellence.
"“The reason people blame things on others is that there’s really only one other choice.”
—Jane Flaherty
Strategy 57: Take Responsibility!"
"Up until his untimely death in July 2006, Ken Lay, former CEO of Enron, claimed ignorance about the depth of Enron’s financial problem and blamed the severity of the problems on some rogue managers at lower levels in the organization."
"Several of the major airlines, with the exception of Southwest, blame their lack of profitability on September 11, 2001, the price of fuel, and too much competition."
"In a 2004 study of annual reports, Fiona Lee of the University of Michigan and Larissa Tiedens of Stanford found that stock prices were higher one year later when companies blamed poor performance on controllable internal factors rather than on external issues."
"They analyzed 21 years’ worth of “Letters to the Shareholders” in annual reports for 14 companies in three industries: pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, and industrial equipment."
"By hypothetically picking stocks based on how managers explained negative performance (self-blaming vs. other-blaming), the researchers found the stocks of the five most self-blaming companies yielded an adjusted return of 14–19 percent more than the stocks of the five most other-blaming companies."
Excuses are also an ineffective customer service strategy; they tend to upset customers and make bad situations even worse.
"Admitting a


mistake and correcting the problem increases the chances of a customer returning and doing business with you again."
"Your customers are loyal because they trust that, when there is a problem, your company will take responsibility and correct the problem.11
Howard Schultz, Starbucks founder and CEO, is a leader who knows how to take responsibility for mistakes."
"When Starbucks missed its sales and profit expectations in 2007, Schultz could have blamed the lack of sales and profits on the economy, the time of year, or even the consumer price index."
"Instead, in an interview with Andy Serwer, Schultz stated, “I want to be clear that I take full responsibility for where our company is now and also for where it will be going forward.”12
Another CEO who knows the importance of taking responsibility is Blair Sadler, the retired CEO of Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego."
"In March 2006, the unthinkable happened at Rady Children’s Hospital."
"Within a period of about two weeks, two employees were accused of either molesting children or being in possession of child pornography."
"The 2,800 employees and 750 physicians at Children’s, the very people who dedicated their lives to protecting children from harm, were devastated."
"In this situation, some leaders may have tried to minimize the story or put a positive spin on the news."
"Instead, Sadler held a news conference with San Diego’s Police Chief William Lansdowne and said, “Our hiring standards require extensive criminal background checks on all new employees and volunteers."
"We require and provide annual training on child-abuse prevention, identification, and reports for all staff, every three months.”13 Sadler went on to state that these numerous safeguards at the hospital apparently were not enough to prevent what occurred."
"Everyone makes mistakes, and things do happen that are outside your sphere of control."
"What everyone knows, though, is that excuses stink."
Taking responsibility for your department or organization’s problems shows great leadership.
"When leaders admit mistakes and problems and provide a clear strategy to resolve the problem, employees find it easier to respect and follow the person who has control over the outcome."
"When employees hear leaders complain that problems are externally controlled, it is hard for them to gain motivation to fix something over which, no matter what they do, they have no control."
"Apologize, take ownership, and take responsibility to fix the problem."
"“Accountability breeds response-ability.”
—Stephen R. Covey
Strategy 58: Resolve Conflicts Quickly
There are some consultants who make their entire living conducting seminars on conflict resolution."
There is a reason for this: The cultures of some organizations avoid resolving conflicts.
"In these organizations, conflict becomes a big “un-discussable.” Everyone will talk about the disagreement one-on-one, but no one has the courage to call a meeting, put the conflict in the middle of the table, and discuss it with the people who can come up with an agreeable solution."
"The conflict consultants tell us disagreement can be good if, for example, it brings together people who do not see eye-to-eye and the outcomes are a stronger relationship and a better solution."
We agree.
We also believe that the only good conflict in organizations is the one that gets resolved quickly.
"Whether it is two team members who are not on the same page, or two departments going head-to-head, if the conflict is resolved promptly, it is good."
"If the conflict lingers on, a huge amount of time is wasted because people’s energies are focused on peripheral issues that are not productive to creating organizational success."
"When an organizational assessment reveals there is unresolved conflict, the people promoting the conflict are like different teams competing in a league."
Neither wins.
The only team that is really winning in this league is their competitor.
"To resolve conflicts quickly, you will find it helpful to:
 Force communication."
"When there is conflict, most people would rather avoid going head-on to discuss the situation."
Setting up a meeting as quickly as possible is the first step.
 Meet face-to-face.
There are some people who will walk a mile around the office to complain about someone who sits right next to them.
Or they send a nasty e-mail.
"In resolving conflict, face-to-face is better."
 Develop options.
The most difficult people to deal with in the world are unilateral thinkers.
We know them as the “my way or the highway” folks.
"If there are two or three options, most times you can reach resolution."
 Use your organization’s vision as a guidepost.
"When in con- flict, don’t lose sight of your organization’s vision."
"Often, it will serve as a compass to focus your discussions and possible resolutions to the problem being addressed."
"Keep discussions open, considering multiple alternatives."
 Agree on next actions.
It is important to leave this discus- sion with actions or next steps in place.
 Follow up.
"Before you end the meeting, set up the next meeting to discuss what went well or right since the first meeting and identify any course corrections that need to be made."
"“You can’t shake hands with a clenched fist.”
—Indira Gandhi

Strategy 59: Give Gossipers and Whiners More Work
If there is one thing that can kill an environment that promotes workplace excellence, it is gossipers who spend a large portion of their time spreading ill will."
Gossipers usually do not spend time talking positively about others and the organization.
"Instead, they gossip about how good things used to be in the past."
"They
gripe about how current decisions are wrong for the organization."
They criticize team members’ inadequacies and mistakes.
"When it comes to gossipers and whiners, it is important to focus on the real problem."
"The focus is not the unhappy employees going around wasting their, and everyone else’s, time gossiping."
"The concern is how much time these discontents
have on their hands in the first place."
The real problem is managers who do not give gossipers and whiners enough work to do and then don’t hold them accountable to high performance and the completion of all work that is assigned to them.
"If you keep increasing the workload every time someone finds the time to gossip, one of three things is going to happen: (1) the gossipers are going to run out of time to gossip and get the job done; (2) the gossipers will get so frustrated and angry that they now have to work they will quit; or (3) the gossipers will be coached and counseled out of the organization on accountability issues."
"With any of these outcomes, you are one step closer to workplace excellence."
"Every time you see or hear someone gossiping or whining, remember this: The person does not have enough work to do."
"“Gossip is a sort of smoke that comes from the dirty tobacco pipes of those who diffuse it: it proves nothing but the bad taste of the smoker.”
—George Eliot
Strategy 60: Deal With Bullies or Abusive People in the Organization
Number one on the list of stupid behaviors is the inability to control emotions."
"Whether it is anger, moodiness, or inappropriate responses to everyday situations, emotional people come across as bullies, either passively or actively, and they are mentally abusive to others in the organization."
Our clients recognize that these individuals are a threat to a culture of workplace excellence and put a stop to these inappropriate behaviors in one of two ways.
"First, in most of these situations, our clients hire a coach to help the bullies learn better ways to communicate with others in the organization."
We have learned that about 50 percent of the people we coach change their behaviors and become even stronger contributors to the organization’s success.
These leaders embrace the coach’s suggestions and are active learners in becoming more effective leaders.
We’ve also learned that the other 50 percent exhibit what we refer to as Popeye syndrome (see page 101).
"These individuals do not feel responsible for their own behaviors, much less their impact on others."
They are proud of themselves and their past results.
"Because these individuals are unwilling to change and they say, “I am what I am,” many of the Popeye Syndrome managers end up being fired after several months of working with the coach."
"In most of these instances, these individuals view the coaching process


as punitive or remedial."
"In the relationship with the coach, these individuals hold one, nonverbalized goal: “What do I have to do or say to get this executive coach out of my life?”
Amazing as it sounds, we have worked with executives, whose annual salaries exceeded $700,000, who lost their jobs because they were unwilling to change."
"The second alternative our clients take is giving the dysfunctional bully an ultimatum that goes something like this: “You either agree to change your behavior or sign a separation agreement.”
Most bullies or abusive people in organizations earn a reputation for producing spectacular results."
That is why they are more difficult to deal with than a poor performer.
"With a weak performer who is an abusive bully, it is an easy decision."
You fire the person as quickly as possible.
It is a much more difficult decision when the bully is a top-producing individual.
Organizations that build a reputation for workplace excellence recognize that both results—and how they are produced—are critical for the organization’s success.
"“Courage is fire, and bullying is smoke.”
—Benjamin Disraeli
Strategy 61: Enforce the Company’s Policy on Harassment
As we enter the new decade, we keep thinking that harassment will no longer be an issue in organizations."
Wrong!
"Each year, some of the nation’s leading law firms refer to us for coaching leaders who have been accused of harassment."
"Though it comes in many forms, most instances of harassment are revealed by behaviors that are not welcomed by others in the workplace."
Disrespectful behaviors have always been wrong.
They are still wrong today.
"If you are a manager who is harassing another team member, the company will always be liable and, in many states, you could be held personally liable."
Best- of-the-Best organizations and leaders state a policy of zero tolerance when it comes to harassment.
"It is worth noting that, as the workforce becomes younger, more and more people will bring a stronger understanding of what harassment means."
"Nowadays, in the first year of middle school, students learn that, although flirting may be welcome, unwanted harassment is not."
These new workers may know the laws better than many seasoned managers.
"However, you should not enforce the company’s policy on harassment only because you might be sued."
"Rather, enforce the policy because it is the right thing to do and because your goal is to create an environment where all employees can give their optimal performance."
"“When people honor each other, there is a trust established that leads to synergy, interdependence, and deep respect."
"Both parties make decisions and choices based on what is right, what is best, what is valued most highly.”
—Blaine Lee
Strategy 62: Don’t Be Held Hostage
When an inadequate performer threatens to quit, which seldom happens, the decision to accept the offer is an easy one to make."
The decision is much more difficult when the threat comes from a top performer.
What should you do when you have a top performer who is exceedingly difficult to work with?
"When it comes to results on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 1 represent- ing low and 10, high), these top performers get a 10."
They get the job done and the results are spectacular.
The challenge is that they leave a wake of “debris” as they pass and it splashes up on everyone.
"As the leader, you deal with constant complaints from these top performers’ direct reports, peers, and sometimes even a customer."
"Although the top performers may be a little arrogant, demanding, or even abrasive at times, you make excuses for them because you don’t have to worry about their results."
"One more thing about these high performers: Every time you try to hold them accountable for how they treat and interact with people, they blame others and threaten to quit."
So you start to dance around these difficult people in the hopes that you can convince them to stay.
Perhaps you even contemplate hiring an executive coach to help smooth over the rough edges.
"Most of the time, your gut tells you that these behaviors need to change, but your head makes excuses because these team members are so good at the technical aspects of the job."
"When you fall into this trap and start to make excuses, even to the point of trying to talk them out of quitting, you need to have your business cards reprinted with a new title: Hostage."
Most people who are difficult to deal with and who threaten to quit seldom do.
"There is a reason these troublesome people don’t leave the or- ganization: Deep down inside, they know they are tough to deal with and the next company they join may not be as tolerant of their abusive behav- iors."
They have fewer options for future employment because everyone who has ever worked with them never wants to work with them again.
So here is the lesson: Don’t be held hostage.
"If people threaten to quit, you can assume they are not happy with your organization or the specific changes you are proposing that they make."
"When people are not happy and are difficult to work with, an excellent work environment cannot take root."
"Let these individuals know that leaving the organization is a real possibility and, if they are unwilling to make the changes in behavior you are discussing, you are willing to help them transition to another organization."
The new person you hire will not be making everyone’s life miserable.
"The new person will have only two questions for you and the team: (1) “What do you need me to do?” and (2) “How soon do you need me to accomplish the task or goal?” When you can finally remove the word Hostage from your business cards, you will once again be able to say, “I love my job.”
“Whatever course you decide upon, there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong."
There are always difficulties arising which tempt you to believe that your critics are right.
"To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires courage.”
—Ralph Waldo Emerson
Strategy 63: Share Your Poorest Performers With a Competitor
People with performance problems deserve four things from their boss and the organization:
 Clearly defined performance goals."
 Timely feedback if the goals are not being achieved.
 Crystal-clear knowledge of the consequences if the performance does not improve in a specific time frame.
" Support to help the poor performance improve by, for example, training or mentoring."
"The question that leaders ask is: “What happens when you have done the above four steps, sometimes in multiple rounds, and the employee still does not improve?” If the employee remains a poor performer, here is a tip to help construct an even more positive, effective workplace: Share this person with a competitor."
"There is no greater strategic action than to take your worst- performing employee and give that person the opportunity to undermine the teamwork, productivity, quality, and customer service at someone else’s company, preferably your toughest competitor."
Why don’t more leaders practice the strategy of sharing their poorest performers with a competitor?
Many leaders hope that their inadequate performers will improve.
"When hope does not work, some leaders will try a hint."
"When hope and hint do not work, they often resort to prayer."
"Difficult employees usually do not respond well to hope, hint, or prayer."
They do respond well when they watch a leader in the organization effectively and swiftly deal with weak performance.
"Most leaders in this new situation only regret one thing, which is that they did not share the poor performer with a top competitor much sooner."
“Some difficult employees are like wheelbarrows.
"Easily upset, they are only useful when pushed by someone else.”
—Peter Barron Stark
Strategy 64: Smash the Time Clock
Most organizations develop a corporate culture that tells people how many hours they need to be on-site working."
Hourly employees are given clearly identified start and stop times.
"In every organization, there will always be people who are assigned specific times they need to be at work."
"Customers expect to be served and supported when the business is open, and the employees who serve them will always be accountable to be at work during a specific time."
"In every organization, there are positions where it does not matter when the work gets started, as long as the desired end result is achieved and the work is completed on time."
"To create workplace excellence, set high expectations and focus on the results of the individual, not the hour hand on the time clock."
"In most organizations, if you do not show up for work you are going to be fired."
"Best Buy, one of the nation’s largest electronics retailers, has implemented a policy called ROWE at their Minneapolis headquarters."
"ROWE stands for “Results Oriented Work Environment.” In putting ROWE into practice, Best Buy is trying to change from an environment of working long hours under stress, to an environment that emphasizes results."
"In other words, Best Buy is smashing the time clock by realizing it is not the number of hours an employee spends at the office that counts, but rather what that person produces."
"If you wish to adopt the ROWE philosophy, we recommend four steps to success."
"First, both managers and employees need to be clear on what results are needed and when those results are due."
"Second, increase communication among the manager, the employee, and the team."
"When you are out of sight, it is easy to let up on commu- nicating with each other."
Use the abundant technology available today to stay in touch and keep current.
Practice the concept of “no sur- prises” and over-communicate so everyone stays connected.
"Third, hold consistent team meetings, either by phone or in the office."
It is critical that the team does not become a group of individuals all doing their own thing.
"Fourth, managers need to recognize that a ROWE may not be appli- cable to every employee."
Some people are self-motivated producers and in reality don’t even need a manager.
"Others, without strong oversight, will mess up the “R” part of the ROWE."
"Hold everyone accountable and this new policy offers a great opportunity for even more employees to say, “I love my job!”
“Don’t tell people how to do things."
"Tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results.”
—General George S. Patton
Strategy 65: Do the Right Thing!"
"Former congressman Duke Cunningham, an eight-term legislator from San Diego, California, went to prison in March 2006, for taking more than $2,400,000 in bribes from federal contractors."
"Cunningham either asked the contractors for money in return for lobbying for contracts that would benefit them, or he was offered money in return for the favors."
"In February 2007, Brent Wilkes, the Poway, California,


businessman who owned a company that contracted with the U.S. government, was indicted and found guilty of bribing Cunningham."
Federal prosecutors recommended Wilkes be sentenced to a 60-year prison term.
Cunningham and the contractors had the opportunity to say no and do the right thing.
They chose not to.
"One public servant who did do the right thing, even when it cost him and the City of New York big time, was New York’s past mayor, Rudy Giuliani."
"After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, a Saudi prince, Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdul Aziz Alsaud, toured Ground Zero and then wrote a check to the City of New York for $10,000,000."
"Most cities and their mayors would be excited any time someone gave them a check for
$10,000,000."
"The trouble was, the prince also included a press release with his donation."
"The press release stated:
“However, at times like this one, we must address some of the issues that led to such a criminal attack."
I believe the government of the United States of America should re-examine its policies in the Middle East and adopt a more balanced stance toward the Palestinian cause.
"Our Palestinian brethren continue to be slaughtered at the hands of Israelis while the world turns the other cheek.”
The mayor, who had been told of the press release just moments before his daily briefing but after receiving the check, was visibly annoyed by it."
"“I entirely reject that statement,” he said."
"“That’s totally contrary to what I said at the United Nations,” he added, referring to his address to the international body.14 As hard as it must have been to turn away that much money, Giuliani told the prince to take his
$10,000,000 and shove it sideways up his oil rig."
"Regardless of what situation you may find yourself and/or your firm mired in, there is never an excuse for violating your own principles and morals or for breaking the law."
"In effect, there is never a right time to do the wrong thing."
"“The time is always right to do what is right.”
—Martin Luther King, Jr.


Strategy 66: Swim With the Dolphins
When it comes to achieving performance, there are four types of workers who, amazingly enough, mimic the behaviors of sea creatures: dolphins, cross-eyed dogfish, carp, and sharks."
"  Dolphins
Whether they swim with sharks, carp, or cross-eyed dogfish, dolphins are incredibly effective at producing top-quality results."
And they achieve those results by living the company’s values.
Dolphins are always thinking ahead and planning their next strategy.
"They learn from, and respond appropriately to, their rapidly changing environment."
You know what to do with dolphins.
"You want to give them even more responsibility in the organization and, if you could find more dolphins, you would hire them."
" Cross-eyed dogfish
Dogfish are ineffective at producing results."
"They don’t get their own jobs done, but are really good at creating more work for others in the organization."
"If that were not enough, cross-eyed dogfish are not even nice."
"Difficult to get along with as team members, they are also low on character."
You do not trust that they will do what they say they are going to do.
Cross-eyed dogfish set low personal standards and then consistently fail to achieve them.
You also know what to do with the cross-eyed dogfish: Fire him or her and hire a dolphin!
"  Carp
Really nice organizations struggle with the question “What do you do with the carp?” A challenge because they do not produce significant results, carp are really pleasant and people in the organization like them."
"In fact, if you let a carp go, there are always other carp who talk about how much the organization is changing for the worse."
"A carp’s favorite lines, when a fellow carp is let go, are “Our organization used to be like a family” and “We used to care about people.” With carp, you want to coach, counsel, and train."
"If that does not work, make a hard decision."
"Share the carp with a competitor who values really nice, easy-going, ineffective employees."
"  Sharks
Sharks are the most difficult employees to fire because no one likes to sacrifice anyone who produces."
The challenge with sharks is how they achieve their results.
"Sharks do not live the organization’s values, much less follow the character behaviors of positive leaders."
"A favorite line of a shark is “I am paid to do a job.” Sharks will do whatever it takes, including running over people or compromising ethics, to get the job done."
"Like carp, sharks need to be coached, counseled, and retrained."
"You don’t want to lose their results, but how they achieve them has a big impact on organizational excel- lence."
"Unfortunately, if the coaching and counseling do not work, sharks need to go."
"To be successful in effectively managing performance, you need to let the cross-eyed dogfish go and hire more dolphins."
These are easy decisions that need to be made quickly.
"With the carp and sharks, you need to coach, counsel, and train."
"To create excellence in the workplace, other employees must either see positive changes in the shark and carp behaviors or watch those colleagues swim away."
"“Learn to adjust yourself to the conditions you have to endure, but make a point of trying to alter or correct conditions so that they are most favorable to you.”
—William Frederick Book

Key #8: Every Employee Learns and Grows
We have already shown that Best-of-the-Best organizations are better at defining job responsibilities and performance measurements than other organizations."
Their leaders do a finer job of providing constructive feedback to employees about their performance.
"The ingredients that bind these concepts together are the training program that prepares people to do their job, and the professional development that enables them to go above and beyond it."
"Not only do 84.1 percent of the staff at Best-of-the-Best companies believe their organizations


have a good training program, but 86.3 percent believe the training improves their job skills."
Their recognition of the company’s support of their careers is such that 83.3 percent believe there is a career opportunity at their workplace in the next three years.
"Strategy 67: Ensure That Everyone Has a Growth and Development Plan
We feel strongly that every employee in your organization needs a plan in order to learn and grow."
"Most people find that when they are learning and growing, they are more motivated."
"When employees feel stagnant in their jobs, they usually feel that their growth is stunted."
"Each year, put specific learning and growth goals on paper, both for you and each of your direct reports."
It is important to ask your employees to define their growth goals.
"It may include formal training or cross-training with another employee or department, or it could mean taking a course at a local college."
"If employees are not involved in defining the learning and growth goals, they tend to feel less empowered in the process."
"When people do not feel empowered, they lose motivation."
"“The growth and development of people is the highest calling of leadership.”
—Harvey S. Firestone
Strategy 68: Be a Mentor
Every year, hundreds of organizations start the process to begin a mentor or succession-planning program."
The purpose of the programs— to develop talent—is awesome.
The worst programs we have ever been involved with were the ones that made formal assignments of mentor and protégé.
"The organiza- tion’s human resources or organizational development departments prescribed exactly what needed to happen in the program, including how many times the mentor and protégé should meet on an annual basis."
"The protégé felt like an intruder into the mentor’s busy schedule, while the mentor felt compelled to give the mentee some quality time."
"The mentor would ask, “What can I do to help you in your career?” After one hour of forced communication, both participants crossed the meeting off of their to-do lists."
"The best mentor programs are informal philosophies where organizations place a high value on helping people to grow and develop, both personally and professionally."
"When the leaders in the organization put into action the value of helping people to grow and develop, being a mentor works incredibly well."
"For instance, a leader takes a subordinate to a Toastmasters’ meeting because she believes that improved communication skills will help the employee’s career; another invites a peer or subordinate to a meeting he would never be asked to attend on his own; or a mentor gives an employee a project that stretches her current capabilities."
These are examples of leaders who truly care about the success of someone else in the organization.
"“The power of one man or one woman doing the right thing for the right reason, and at the right time, is the greatest influence in our society.”
—Jack Kemp
Strategy 69: Continuously Delegate Increased Responsibility
To find the time needed to focus on “cool stuff” and create an environment that produces significant results, you need to continuously delegate."
Delegation frees you up from tactical tasks and allows you to concentrate on the strategic work that leads to innovation.
Delegation also helps your team members grow.
"To be effective at delegating, two dynamics come into play."
"The first action to effectively delegate a task or responsibility to another is that you need to trust people, and you will especially need to trust that specific person."
Trust is one of the qualities that distinguishes Best-of-the-Best leaders.
(You can follow the steps to building trusting relationships listed in Chapter 3.)
"Second, you have to have confidence that, if something does go wrong, you have the ability to correct any situation."
Trust in others and confidence in yourself—these are the two key actions for effective delegating.
"In his autobiography, My American Journey (Ballantine Books, 1996), Colin Powell tells a story about how President Reagan once signed a photograph of Powell briefing the president in the Oval Office."
"At the bottom of the photo, Reagan wrote, “If you say so, Colin, it must be right.”15


“No man will make a great leader who wants to do it all himself or get all the credit.”
—Andrew Carnegie
Strategy 70: Be a Pygmalion: Believe in People
Whether you trust that people on your team are capable of doing the job, or do not trust that people are capable of doing the job, you are right!"
"In Greek mythology, a sculptor, Pygmalion, sought to carve an ivory statue of the ideal woman."
"The statue, which he named Galatea, was so beautiful that Pygmalion fell desperately in love with his own creation."
He prayed to the goddess Venus to bring Galatea to life.
Venus granted his prayer and the couple lived happily ever after.
"Inspired, George Bernard Shaw wrote a play called Pygmalion."
"In Shaw’s play, which was made into the Broadway musical and movie My Fair Lady, snobbish phonetics professor Henry Higgins wagers that he can take a Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, and, with some vigorous training, present her in high society as a duchess."
Higgins succeeds.
"A key point lies in a comment by Eliza to Higgins’s friend Colonel Pickering: “You see, really and truly, apart from the things anyone can pick up (the dressing and the proper way of speaking and so on), the difference between a lady and a flower girl is not how she behaves, but how she’s treated."
"I shall always be a flower girl to Professor Higgins, because he always treats me as a flower girl, and always will."
"But I know I can be a lady to you because you always treat me as a lady, and always will.”
In organizations, the Pygmalion effect is the recognition that your expectations of an individual can radically influence that individual’s behavior and perceived performance."
This is the actual reason why the best mentor-protégé relationship occurs when the mentor believes that the protégé can rise to an even higher level in the organization and the mentor goes out of the way to ensure that the protégé succeeds.
"If you trust that someone can do the job, you tend to pass along increased responsibilities and share knowledge to help the individual grow and develop."
"“Whether you think you can or whether you think you can’t, you’re right.”
—Henry Ford


Key #9: Problems…No Problem!"
"If you are a customer with a problem that a company resolves quickly and cheerfully, aren’t you more likely to be loyal to that organization?"
"Best-of-the-Best companies believe this is true, as evidenced by the powerful statement that 90 percent of their staff members believe their companies want them to solve problems."
"(In comparison, only 73 percent of the employees in the Overall Benchmark feel their companies want them to be problem-solvers.)"
Both internal and external problems can be solved with a staff of innovators who quickly grasp the issue and then take action.
That’s an environment of workplace excellence that motivates staff and customers.
"Strategy 71: Empower Employees
Webster’s Dictionary defines empower as “to give official authority.” Real empowerment means giving employees the information they require to make decisions without having to go to a supervisor or manager for approval."
"To be fully empowered, employees need the accountability, responsibility, and authority to make a decision."
Enlightened organizations do just that.
"One example is Sheraton Universal Hotel in Universal City, California, where the front desk manager has the complete authority to provide upgrades or discounts to solve customer problems."
A famous example of an organization that empowers employees is Nordstrom.
"New employees are given a copy of the famous Nordstrom Employee Handbook—a single 5x8-inch gray card containing 75 words:
WELCOME TO NORDSTROM
We’re glad to have you with our Company."
Our number one goal is to provide outstanding customer service.
Set both your personal and professional goals high.
We have great confidence in your ability to achieve them.
Nordstrom Rules: Rule #1: Use your good judgment in all situations.
There will be no additional rules.
"Please feel free to ask your department manager, store manager, or division general manager any question at any time."
The handbook clearly tells employees they have one goal: to do whatever it takes to make customers happy.
"Other organizations say the words, but will not let employees act on them."
"Their empowerment reaches as far as “You are empowered as long as you don’t make a decision.” Or, “Before you make the decision, ask me.” Or worse, “Why did you make that decision?"
"Now you are in big trouble.”
When we ask employees if they have the ability to make decisions to improve quality or solve customer problems, 85 percent of the employees in the Best-of-the-Best Benchmark responded favorably that they do."
The companies in the Overall Benchmark scored an approximately 79 percent favorable response.
The data in both benchmarks tell us that companies who care about what their employees think will work hard to empower them to take responsibility and make the right decisions.
"In today’s challenging business environment, employee empow- erment can improve the level of customer service and provide man- agement with time to run the business and make important strategic decisions."
"“The best executive is the one who has sense enough to pick good men to do what he wants done, and self-restraint enough to keep from meddling with them while they do it.”
—Theodore Roosevelt
Strategy 72: Identify and Handle Problems Quickly
Most organizations are great at identifying problems."
What separates Best-of-the-Best organizations is that they are quick to fix problems.
An example of this became apparent when we worked with a major league sports franchise.
"The three months prior to the opening of the season, people in the ball club were commenting that attendance for the first three games was not going to meet the budgeted goals."
The first three games came and went.
"Despite fireworks and a giveaway, attendance was way below expectations."
"In an interview, one employee stated that the club’s previous president would have called a meeting two months prior to the start of the season and facilitated a cross-departmental action plan of how to boost attendance."
"Best-of-the-Best leaders have an attitude about problems, which is that problems give leaders a purpose."
"If there were no problems, there is a good chance the leader would not be needed."
"As one person


said, “The only people who have no problems are dead people.” If you look at that comment from the opposite side of the fence, the more problems you have, the more alive you are!"
"When they are resolved quickly, problems make an organization even stronger."
"As a leader, it is imperative that you take charge and facilitate a solution to problems that threaten the operation and productivity of your particular organization."
"It is extremely important that you first listen carefully when a direct report and/or colleague comes to you with an issue, then investigate for yourself and prepare to take effective action."
"Given the incredibly competitive marketplace, you must prevent an apparently miniscule problem from snowballing out of control into a potentially organization-killing monster."
"“The ‘how’ thinker gets problems solved effectively because he wastes no time with futile ‘ifs’ but goes right to work on the creative ‘how’.”
—Norman Vincent Peale

Key #10: It’s All About the Customer
It would be difficult in today’s world to find a company that admitted to being indifferent about customer service."
"After all, service is the special quality that positions one organization higher than others in the minds of their customers."
"Service attracts loyal customers, who ultimately ink in the bottom line."
A substantial 94.3 percent of employees at Best-of-the-Best organizations report that their companies place a high value on customer service.
"But, showing that the organization also walks the talk, 89 percent say their company’s policies and procedures enable them to provide high-quality service."
That support is the appreciable difference between a good company and a great Best-of-the-Best company.
"Strategy 73: Create Policies and Procedures That Better Serve Both the Needs of Your Customers and Your Staff
For decades, the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) in California upheld a reputation for being a bureaucratic nightmare of stationary lines."
"There was a line for getting a driver’s license, a line for


taking the test, and another line for obtaining a copy of your driving record."
There was a separate line for anything you could possibly want from the DMV.
The amazing thing about all these lines is that they were designed for one purpose: the convenience of the staff at the DMV.
There is nothing convenient for the customer about standing in multiple lines to get various tasks accomplished.
"A second frustrating policy of the DMV, right behind the multiple lines, was scheduling all its employees to take their lunch break between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m."
"Yes, we all agree that this is the designated lunch time, but these are the exact times that most people are able to go the DMV to be served."
"To be fair, today you can call the DMV and actually schedule an appointment to get your vehicle needs accomplished."
"The appoint- ment may not be the equivalent of a personal shopping experience at Nordstrom, but it is better than wasting a good portion of your day standing in line."
"When organizations design new policies that are convenient for the customer, many times—in the beginning stages of implementation— the new policies are difficult for the staff to master."
"With time, staff members find that they like working with happy customers even better, and the new policies become routine."
Designing policies and procedures with the customer in mind helps create workplace excellence.
Remember: The number-one goal is to create an environment where employees love to come to work and customers love to do business.
Designing policies that are flexible to meet the needs of your workforce and customers is critical for your organization’s success.
It is difficult to please customers if the employees delivering the service are not engaged.
"Policies allowing part-time employment, flexible hours, telecommuting, or job-sharing may help engage a workforce that is even more motivated to meet the needs of customers."
"When it comes to producing results, there are some part-time employees who can out- produce someone working full-time."
We are moving into an environment where there will be a shortage of well-qualified employees.
"Establishing policies that meet the needs of employees, and developing relationships that build loyal customers will help organizations be even more successful in the future."
“Customers don’t expect you to be perfect.
"They do expect you to fix things when they go wrong.”
—Donald Porter
Strategy 74: Stop Beating a Dead Horse
Mary Bradley, a veteran respiratory therapist on the Rady Children’s Hospital’s well-regarded Advanced Life Support team, brought a stuffed pony that was about 2 feet tall to a team meeting."
"When the team started to rehash and complain about an issue for the umpteenth time, she tossed the pony into the middle of the room, gave team members a stick, and said, “If we can’t get over this, then we need to beat this dead horse one more time.” Because no one on the team wanted to be the one beating a dead horse, the team refocused on what actions they needed to take to improve the situation."
"Most times, when people are beating a dead horse, they have lost sight of both the cus- tomer and the vision."
To repeatedly bring up a particular topic with no chance of affect- ing the outcome is beating a dead horse.
"It is an action with no purpose because no matter how hard or how long you beat a dead horse, it is not going to get up and run."
"Unfortunately, some people cannot stop themselves."
"For those team members, we sourced the Internet and customized 26 new strategies you should try."
1.
Some horses are really strong willed.
Buy a stronger whip!
2.
Maybe it is the rider who is dead.
Change riders!
3.
"Says things such as “This is the way we have always ridden this horse.”
4."
"Appoint a committee to study the horse and make recommendations to revive it, such as “We need to put some lipstick on this pig.”
5."
Arrange to visit other organizations to see how they ride dead horses.
6.
Increase the standards to ride dead horses.
7.
Get teams to argue about non-issues that take the focus off the dead horse.
8.
Get the organizational development team to institute a mandatory training session to increase our riding capacity.
9.
"Get a strong leader in the company to make a speech and state that “This horse will never die on my watch.”
10."
"Change the requirements to prove that “This horse is not dead.”
11."
Hire contractors or consultants who lack business knowledge to ride the dead horse.
12.
Harness several dead horses together to give the perception of increased power and speed.
13.
"Declare that “No horse is too dead to beat.”
14."
"Provide additional funding to increase the horse’s “functional life.”
15."
Do a cost-benefit analysis to see if contractors can ride the horse cheaper.
16.
Write a proposal to find the lowest price consultant to do CPR on the horse.
17.
Buy a commercial off-the-shelf dead horse.
No sense inventing a new dead horse.
18.
Purchase a product to make dead horses run faster.
19.
"Declare the horse is now “better, faster, and cheaper.”
20."
"Form a brainstorming session, where every idea is valued, to find new uses for dead horses."
21.
Empower employees to bring the dead horse back to life.
22.
BRAC (Base Realignment and Closure) the horse farm on which the dead horse was born.
23.
Promote the dead horse to a management position so more dead horses can be rewarded.
24.
Rename the dead horse “Paradigm Shift” and keep riding it for a few more years.
25.
"Tell people they need to “get out of the box” and ride the dead horse “smarter” not “harder.”


26."
Get the Information Technology Help Desk team involved.
They will tell you to reboot your dead horse with a Control-Alt-Delete maneuver.
"Don’t be surprised if
the horse momentarily comes alive again, until you retry the identical task that killed the horse the first time and triggered the call to the Help Desk."
"If all these strategies fail, hire a consultant to help the team create a powerful positive vision of your customers happily riding dead horses, with all four legs sticking straight up in the air, for many years to come."
“The single most important thing to remember about any enterprise is that there are no results inside its walls.
"The result of a business is a satisfied customer.”
—Peter Drucker
Strategy 75: Recognize That the Customer Is Not Always Right
Gordon Bethune left the Boeing Company in 1994 to become president and CEO of Continental Airlines, at the time the fifth-largest airline in the United States."
"When Bethune took over, Continental, losing $55,000,000 per month, was widely recognized in the industry as providing the worst service of the country’s 10 largest airlines, and was on the verge of declaring bankruptcy for the third time in a decade."
"Within two years, Continental had turned around, posting the first of 11 straight quarters of record profits, and consistently ranking among the best airlines in customer satisfaction surveys."
"Bethune’s emphasis in turning Continental Airlines around, as explained in his best-seller, From Worst to First (John Wiley, 1998), was in satisfying customers and employees and ensuring that both groups remained happy with how Continental treated them."
"However, Bethune also made it clear that the cliché “the customer is always right” philosophy didn’t always apply at Continental, and that when conflicts arose between employees and abusive customers, he would side with employees:
When we run into customers that we can’t reel back in, our loyalty is with our employees."
They have to put up with this stuff every day.
Just because you buy a ticket does not give you the right to abuse our employees….
"We run more than three


million people through our books every month."
"One or two of those people are going to be unreasonable, demanding jerks."
"When it’s a choice between supporting your employees, who work with you every day and make your product what it is, or some irate jerk who demands a free ticket to Paris because you ran out of peanuts, whose side are you going to be on?"
You can’t treat your employees like serfs.
You have to value them….
"If they think that you won’t support them when a customer is out of line, even the smallest problem can cause resentment."
"GORDON BETHUNE
FORMER CEO, CONTINENTAL AIRLINES16

Bethune shared in his book how he unconditionally supported a flight attendant offended by a passenger’s child wearing a hat with Nazi and KKK emblems on it and asked the man to put the hat away."
"The passenger was very upset, and he followed up with multiple nasty letters and even a visit to Continental’s headquarters."
No amount of customer service could appease him.
"As Bethune concluded, “He bought a ticket on our airplane, and that means we’ll take him
where he wants to go."
"But if he’s going to be rude and offensive, he’s welcome to fly another airline.”
Herb Kelleher, one of the founders of Southwest Airlines, has gone on record with the philosophy that supporting one’s employees is more important than catering to abusive customers."
"An example of Kelleher putting his philosophy into action is
found in Nuts!"
"Southwest Airlines’ Crazy Recipe for Business and Personal Success (Broadway Books, 1998) by our good friends Kevin and Jackie Freiberg."
"Jim Ruppel, director of customer relations, and Sherry Phelps, director of corporate employment, tell the story of a woman who frequently flew on Southwest but was disappointed with every aspect of the company’s operation."
"In fact, she became known as the “Pen Pal” because after every flight, she wrote in with a complaint."
"She didn’t like the fact that the company didn’t assign seats; she didn’t like the absence of a first-class section; she didn’t like not having a meal in flight; she didn’t like Southwest’s boarding procedure; she didn’t like the flight


attendants’ sporty uniforms and the casual atmosphere."
And she hated peanuts!
"Her last letter, reciting a litany of complaints, momentarily stumped Southwest’s customer-relations people."
"Phelps explains: “Southwest prides itself on answering every letter that comes to the company and several employees tried to respond to this customer, patiently explaining why we do things the way we do them."
"[Our response] was quickly becoming a [large] volume until they bumped it up to Herb’s desk, with a note: ‘This one’s yours.’ In sixty seconds, Kelleher wrote back and said, ‘Dear Mrs. Crabapple, We will miss you."
"Love, Herb.’”17
Although there are many examples in organizations where the customer is right, there will always be examples where the customer is not right."
"In those examples, siding with your employees is the right thing to do."
Sending abusive customers to your best competitors is a great strategic action.
It also builds an incredibly loyal relationship between employees and management.
"As Gordon Bethune highlighted very carefully, customers constantly come and go, but your employees are with you day in and day out."
"Your ultimate responsibility, as a leader, is to them."
"“Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.”
—Bill Gates
Strategy 76: Make Your Customer Feel Special
Ask people: “What are you looking for when you are served by others?” Responses will include:
 “I want to be respected.”
 “I want someone to acknowledge me.”
 “I want someone to meet my needs.”
 “I want to quickly find what I’m looking for.”
 “I want someone to answer my questions.”
 “I want someone who serves me with a smile.”
 “I want someone to get me what I want—quickly.”
 “I want someone who appreciates my business.”


When customers are served and these needs are adequately met, your organization can safely say that you have met your customers’ needs."
I (Peter) once had the unfortunate experience of flying United Express and getting to the Santa Maria Airport in central California approximately 40 minutes prior to my flight’s departure.
The lone ticket agent told me that I would not be able to obtain a boarding pass because I did not arrive one hour in advance of my flight.
"As she was leaving the desk to go to the tarmac and greet the arrival of the incoming flight, I shared with the ticket agent that I was unaware of the one-hour advance arrival."
"In response, she pulled out a counter pamphlet, circled the one-hour recommendation, handed it to me, and abandoned the counter."
The flight left without me.
"I was furious, but smart enough to recognize that unless I wanted to drive from Santa Maria to San Diego, I had better be diplomatic in my negotiations."
"Two hours after my scheduled flight departed, the gate agent allowed me to board the next plane heading to Los Angeles."
"Once I arrived home, I sent an e-mail regarding my complaint to United Airlines that stated the following:
If your goal is to close down the Santa Maria Operations and divert passengers to American Airlines out of San Luis Obispo, your ticket counter agents in Santa Maria are doing a great job."
"Six weeks later, United Airlines “promptly” sent their response saying:
Dear Mr. Stark:
Thank you for your letter praising our employees at the Santa Maria Airport."
We are very proud of their dedication to our valued customers.
"Your comments are a tribute to their professionalism, and I know they will appreciate you taking the time from your busy schedule to write."
"I’m sending them a copy of your e-mail, along with our thanks for an outstanding job."
We appreciate this opportunity to be of assistance and look forward to serving you.
I was dumbfounded.
"The same day, I sent a response to United Airlines that stated:
Did anyone read my last e-mail?"
You are compounding the problem.
"Seven days later, United Airlines responded stating:
Thank you for contacting us again."
I apologize if my previous response gave you the impression that I did not read your e-mail.
"While most e-mail communication is informal,
I certainly respect your feelings on this issue as well."
Your feedback is well taken and important to us.
We look forward to another opportunity to serve your travel needs.
Did I feel special?
I felt so special I decided right then and there to only utilize United Airlines as a last resort—when I have no other options!
"During this same time frame, I placed an order with Amazon.com."
Amazon immediately e-mailed me that the product I ordered was not in stock.
"Because it was not, they would ship my product for free when it was back in stock."
"I sent Amazon the following e-mail:
Thank you for informing me that my order will not be shipped today and that the shipping is now free."
I appreciate the great service.
"One hour and six minutes from my first e-mail contact, I received the following response:
Thank you for writing to Amazon.com with your kind comments."
"We want to provide service on a level that customers will remember, and it is always gratifying to know that we have succeeded."
Thanks for taking the time to write to us.
We look forward to filling your order and thank you for shopping at Amazon.com!
"Best Regards,
Harjeev Mehta, Amazon.com Customer Service


Amazon, even in an electronic world, understands how to make customers feel special."
"The counter agent at United Airlines could have cared less how I felt, let alone whether I felt special."
"What is amazing is how many people have come up to us after our speeches and said, “You know, this was a great example."
"I have been served by both of these businesses and I have felt the difference.”
It is pretty simple."
"If you want to provide extraordinary service and build your brand, make your customers feel special."
“Being on par in terms of price and quality only gets you into the game.
"Service wins the game.”
—Tony Alessandra



Part 4
The OUTCOMES
of
WORKPLACE EXCELLENCE






Priceless Outcomes




There are so many things you can buy for your business."
"You can buy the best technology and equipment to support the needs of your employees, and fine furniture to furnish beautiful offices and snappy cubicles."
You can purchase rewards to appropriately recognize your highest achievers.
"You can hire a concierge who runs errands for your employees, and a masseuse to relieve the stress of your work environ- ment."
You can even buy people by paying them a wage they cannot find anywhere else in the universe.
"No matter how hard you try, though, you cannot buy the six most significant outcomes from having an environment where your employees love to come to work and your customers love to do business."
What makes it so difficult for organizations to compete against a company that is in the Best-of-the-Best Benchmark is that the best have achieved these outcomes.
"No matter how hard you try, these outcomes cannot be bought."
That is why these outcomes are priceless.
"Priceless Outcome #1: Employees Feel They Are Treated Fairly
Best-of-the-Best organizations understand that treating people fairly does not mean the same thing as treating people equally."
"If you


treated everyone equally there would be no need to provide people with disabilities with preferential parking and special access to buildings— but if you did not provide preferential parking and special access to the bathrooms in buildings, it would not be fair."
Customers understand the concept of fairness extremely well.
That is why the frequent flier programs have worked so positively in building passenger loyalty with the airlines.
"When a grocery store prints out a
$5 off coupon for the next shopping trip because you bought $250 of groceries during the previous month, the customer behind you does not say, “Hey, that’s not fair.”
Employees who work for Best-of-the-Best organizations share a lot with customers."
"They understand and appreciate being treated fairly, and they recognize that fair does not mean equal."
That is why Best-of- the-Best organizations recognize and value the employees who provide innovation and tirelessly work to solve problems more than they value employees who just do their jobs.
"For the same reasons, the Best-of-the-Best go out of their way to differentiate the rewards given to the top performers."
Holding ev- eryone accountable to clearly communicated performance standards helps to eliminate the feeling of favoritism.
"When all the questions in the employee opinion survey are compared between the two bench- marks, the question regarding favoritism has the widest spread, with the Best-of-the-Best exceeding the Overall Benchmark by 29.3 per- centage points."
"Recently, a CEO told us that he had a policy of not publicly recognizing employees for successful results because he felt it only served to upset the employees who received no recognition."
Duh––it is supposed to!
"The CEO was right that some employees might be upset, but maybe stirring a little uneasiness into the rest of the workforce is not a bad thing."
"If you are fair about how you go about recognizing and rewarding the top performers, maybe more people will say, “Hey, I am also capable of producing extraordinary results.” They might be motivated to raise their contributions to an even higher level."
"When we interview employees in organizations where policies, procedures, and pay systems are not fair, most high performers ask: “Why should I go out of my way to work 12 hours a day when I am


given the same raise as someone who comes to work late each day and struggles to contribute two hours of real work?” It is an excellent question."
"Clearly, communicating performance standards and then holding people accountable to them helps to build an environment that is fair and absent of favoritism."
"Recognizing and rewarding the best performers sends a message that the system is fair, but not equal."
The data demonstrate that the Best-of-the-Best firmly root this concept in their cultures.
"They exceed the organizations in the Overall Benchmark by 14.9 percentage points in response to the statement “At my company, I am treated fairly.”

Priceless Outcome #2: Trust in Management and/or the Owners
Do your employees trust their manager or your management team?"
"It is almost impossible to become a Best-of-the-Best organization when trust in senior or middle management, or even trust with the immediate supervisor, is not present."
Trust pays big dividends.
"A 2005 Watson Wyatt Worldwide study found that companies with high integrity (measured in employee opinion surveys of senior management’s consistency, communication, and other trust-determining behaviors) generated financial returns that were twice those of companies with low integrity levels.1
Unfortunately, trust is an elusive asset in organizations."
The presence of trust is an outcome of how well your organization successfully implements the 10 Keys to Workplace Excellence.
"Our data tell us that a lack of trust in managers, especially senior managers, strongly influences an organization’s ability to establish workplace excellence."
"For example, in response to the statement “I trust the management team,” the Best-of-the-Best exceed our Overall Benchmark by 16 percentage points."
"The higher up you are on the management ladder, the harder it is for you to build a strong bond of trust with your employees because you have less time and opportunities to build one-on-one relationships."
"Although 72.9 percent of the employees strongly agree or agree they trust the management team, even more (80.6 percent) of the employees trust their immediate supervisor."
Priceless Outcome #3: I Love My Job!
"Are you one of the lucky people in this world who can honestly say, “I love my job”?"
"We emphasize the word lucky because, when you love your job, it does not seem like work."
"When you do not love what you do or where you do it, there is nothing harder than work."
"We have interviewed hundreds of people who proudly say, “I love my job.” The interviews revealed that four major features distinguished these people and their work environments."
"First, engaged employees who love their jobs are competent in what they do and confident in how they do it."
"In other words, they are good at their jobs and they know it."
"Second, these engaged employees enjoy variety in their work."
They are not doing the same job over and over each day.
"One moment they are in a meeting with a major customer, the next they are dealing with an employee concern."
Then they work on an idea for a new product or service.
"Last, they spend some of their time returning voice mails and e-mails."
Every day it is something different.
"Third, these employees are empowered to make decisions and take actions to get their jobs accomplished."
"Fourth, people who love their jobs feel challenged to accomplish their work."
They must think in order to get their job done.
"Even though some of the people tell us they find it easy to do their jobs, they also tell us that not everyone is able to successfully do what they do."
People who love their jobs tend to believe that the work they are doing is important.
"Don Phillips, the superintendent of the nationally recognized Poway Unified School District, said it best when he stated in an interview with me (Peter), “We are spending our time on really significant work, and I think we are doing it well.”
What is important to note is that very seldom does one of the employees who loves the job add, “And, I also love the money.” Money will not buy you a love for your job."
Some people like to say that enough money will at least allow you to not hate your job.
We don’t believe it.
We have interviewed too many extremely well-paid people who hate their jobs and would rather be doing anything else.
"When people feel competent and confident about jobs that provide them with challenge, empowerment, and variety, they will develop


passion for and enjoy their jobs."
"Our data show that in response to the statement “People at my company enjoy what they do,” Best-of-the- Best organizations exceed the Overall Benchmark by 15.8 percentage points."
"Priceless Outcome #4: Retention
When companies fail to create workplace excellence and employees are not engaged, the best employees leave first."
They can depart because they are the ones with the greatest number of viable options.
"Everyone who has ever worked with your finest employees, if given the option, would likely follow them to their next organization."
Retention of your top employees becomes a major issue when your organization fails to establish a great working environment.
But your bigger retention problem involves the marginal or poor performers who are happy to stay.
They will remain with your organization for a lifetime because they have very few options.
Anyone who leaves your organization does not plan to take the marginal performers along.
"Unless you plan to change the marginal or poor performers’ behaviors or share them with a competitor, these people are yours for life."
"As we have seen, the Best-of-the-Best do a much better job at main- taining high performance standards in their organizations."
Marginal employees usually do not last long.
Poor and marginal employees best serve Best-of-the-Best organizations by working for a competitor.
"When responding to the statement “My company offers me the chance to have the kind of job I will want three years from now,” Best- of-the-Best employees’ ratings exceeded the ratings from employees in the Overall Benchmark by 15.1 percentage points."
"Employees who feel valued and appreciated, and are given the opportunity to do meaningful work, stay."
"Give employees some say in how their jobs are designed, managed, and measured, and your chances are even higher that you will keep a loyal, engaged workforce."
"Priceless Outcome #5: Employees Feel Valued
In the old days, Mom and Dad worked for one company their entire lives because loyalty to a boss and the employer was very important."
"In


fact, if you held three or four different jobs in a period of 10 years, you were labeled as a drifter."
"Even if our parents did not feel valued, loyalty was perceived as more important than switching jobs."
"Today, if employees do not feel their contributions are valued, they are likely to leave, either physically or mentally."
Successfully implementing the 10 Keys to Workplace Excellence is essential to build an environment where employees feel valued.
Communicating the organization’s vision and expectations for perfor- mance helps to set up employees for success.
"Providing training, and growth and learning opportunities, directly tells employees that they are assets worth the investment."
Recognizing employees for their con- tributions directly lets employees know they are valued.
The impact of feeling valued is that employees feel a stronger bond or connection with their manager and the company.
It does not matter if you are in a personal or business relationship.
"When you feel valued, you are much more willing to go out of your way and supply the discretionary effort to make your counterpart successful and happy."
"Being an employer of first choice, with fully engaged employees, is a great way to work."
"Priceless Outcome #6: Positive Reputation for Workplace Excellence
There are only two types of reputations: good and bad."
Your organization’s success depends on your positive reputation for an environment where your employees love to come to work and your customers love to do business.
"When you establish a positive repu- tation for workplace excellence, people will be attracted to you as an employer, which will make it easier to attract and retain the top talent in the industry."
"Starbucks, which provides benefits to part-time em- ployees who work 240 hours per quarter, has earned this positive repu- tation because it values and invests in its employees."
Would you like to see these priceless outcomes alive in your work- place?
Most managers would say yes.
Great leaders would add that it is difficult to effectively run an organization without these outcomes in place.
These leaders understand that these outcomes are the competi- tive weapons Best-of-the-Best organizations use to win the talent wars and capture profitable market share.
There are some leaders who are so focused on bottom-line results that they don’t think much about the people in their organizations.
There are other leaders who are so concerned about the people that they make bad decisions that ultimately undermine the success of their organizations.
"Great leaders use the 10 keys described in Chapter 2, along with the 76 strategies described in Chapter 6, to create an environment where employees love to come to work and customers love to do business."
The data emphasize the significant difference between Best- of-the-Best organizations and organizations represented in the Overall Benchmark.
The results irrefutably show every leader that it is possible to be focused on both results and people.
We’d be the first to acknowledge that creating workplace excel- lence leading to employee engagement is not easy.
There is great news: Learning from those leaders in Best-of-the-Best organizations and tak- ing action will lead to your long-term success.
"You, too, can experience the benefits and excitement of working with an engaged workforce."
"Don’t wait for the CEO, the human resources department, or your boss to tell you to take action."
No one else can do it.
Creating an engaged workforce starts with you!
