Performance Management Overview
Performance management is the systematic process by which the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) involves its employees, as individuals and members of a group, in improving organizational effectiveness to accomplish the Service's mission and goals."
"Performance management integrates the processes that the IRS uses to:
Communicate and clarify organizational goals to employees."
"Identify individual and, where applicable, team accountability for accomplishing organizational goals."
"Identify and address developmental needs for individuals and, where applicable, teams."
"Assess and improve individual, team, and organizational performance."
Use appropriate measures of performance as the basis for recognizing and rewarding accomplishments.
Use the results of performance appraisals as a basis for appropriate personnel actions.
"The IRS Performance Management program provides a framework for supervisors and employees to improve communications, coordinate planning activities, link individual and organizational performance, and ensure fair and consistent treatment of taxpayers."

"6.430.1.4 (01-01-2007)
Foundation of the Performance Management Program
The foundation of the IRS Performance Management program rests on four guiding principles that:
Strengthen the linkages between performance management and the Service’s mission, strategic business goals, business plans, and the IRS Balanced Measurement System."
"Support the Service’s culture and enhance results through a systematic, ongoing process."
"Change the perception of performance management as a time-consuming, stressful human resource activity to a process for helping achieve business objectives."
Ensure long-term success by balancing the achievement of results with demonstration of actions taken to achieve them.
"6.430.1.5 (01-01-2007)
Key Performance Management Activities
In effective organizations, managers and employees have been practicing good performance management naturally all their lives, executing each key component process well."
Goals are set and work is planned routinely.
Progress toward those goals is measured and employees get feedback.
"High standards are set, but care is also taken to develop the skills needed to reach them."
Formal and informal rewards are used to recognize the behavior and results that accomplish the mission.
"All four component processes working together and supporting each other achieve natural, effective performance management."
"The four steps of IRS performance management are:
Planning expectations
Monitoring progress
Evaluating performance
Recognizing performance

6.430.1.5.1 (01-01-2007)
Planning Expectations
Planning means setting performance expectations and goals for groups and individuals to channel their efforts toward achieving organizational objectives."
"Getting employees involved in the planning process will help them understand the goals of the organization, what needs to be done, why it needs to be done, and how well it should be done."
"In an effective organization, work is planned out in advance."
The regulatory requirements for planning employees' performance include establishing the critical elements and performance standards of their performance plans.
"Performance elements and standards should be measurable, understandable, verifiable, equitable, and achievable."
"Through critical elements, employees are held accountable as individuals for work assignments or responsibilities."
Employee performance plans should be flexible so that they can be adjusted for changing program objectives and work requirements.
"When used effectively, these plans can be beneficial working documents that are discussed often, and not merely paperwork that is filed in a drawer and seen only when ratings of record are required."
"6.430.1.5.2 (01-01-2007)
Monitoring Progress
Monitoring well means consistently measuring performance and providing ongoing feedback to employees and work groups on their progress toward reaching their goals."
"In an effective organization, assignments and projects are monitored continually."
Regulatory requirements for monitoring performance include conducting progress reviews with employees where their performance is compared against their elements and standards.
Ongoing monitoring provides the opportunity to check how well employees are meeting predetermined standards and to make changes to unrealistic or problematic standards.
"And by monitoring continually, unacceptable performance can be identified at any time during the appraisal period and assistance provided to address such performance rather than wait until the end of the period when summary rating levels are assigned."
"6.430.1.5.3 (01-01-2007)
Evaluating Performance
From time to time, organizations find it useful to summarize employee performance."
This can be helpful for looking at and comparing performance over time or among various employees.
Organizations need to know who their best performers are.
"Within the context of formal performance appraisal requirements, rating means evaluating employee or group performance against the critical elements and performance standards in an employee's performance plan and assigning a summary rating of record."
The rating of record is assigned according to procedures included in the Service’s appraisal program and is based on work performed during an entire appraisal period.
"The rating of record has a bearing on various other personnel actions, such as granting within-grade pay increases and determining additional retention service credit in a reduction in force."
"6.430.1.5.4 (01-01-2007)
Recognizing Performance
Rewarding means recognizing employees, individually and as members of groups, for their performance and acknowledging their contributions to the agency's mission."
"In an effective organization, rewards are used well."
Another critical component of recognizing performance is the supervisor's obligation to address employee performance that does not meet performance expectations.
Most performance problems can be resolved through effective communication and counseling between the supervisor and the employee.
Addressing the need for improvement as it is observed will often correct poor performance before a performance-based action is necessary.
Good performance is recognized without waiting for nominations for formal awards to be solicited.
"Recognition is an ongoing, natural part of day-to-day experience."
"A lot of the actions that reward good performance — like saying ""Thank you"" — do not require a specific regulatory authority."
"Award regulations provide a broad range of forms that more formal rewards can take, such as cash, time off, and many nonmonetary items."
"The regulations also cover a variety of contributions that can be rewarded, from suggestions to group accomplishments."

Reviewing Official – The employee's second-level supervisor who reviews and either approves or disapproves the employee's performance agreement for managers and management officials or approves or disapproves the annual performance appraisal that becomes the rating of record for bargaining unit and non-bargaining unit employees covered by CJE performance plans.
"Seasonal Work Schedule – A schedule that requires an employee to work for less than 12 months each year on an annually recurring basis, based on workload and demands of the employer."
"A seasonal employee’s tour of duty may be full-time, part-time or intermittent."
Self-Assessment – A summary narrative prepared by the employee that reflects the accomplishments completed during the appraisal period.
It is given to the rating official for use in preparing the annual performance appraisal.
The self-assessment outlines the actions taken by the employee in achieving the critical performance expectations or performance aspects specified by the CJEs.
Summary Levels – The designators assigned to the summarization of the appraisal of employee performance against individual performance elements.
"Actual performance is compared to the CJEs and performance aspects in the employee’s performance plan or the critical performance expectations for managers, management officials, and confidential management/program analysts."
All IRS performance plans contain five summary levels.
The summary level becomes the employee’s rating of record.
"Summary Rating – Part III of the Manager, Management Official, and Confidential Management/Program Analyst Performance Agreements, Forms 12450-A, B, and D, consisting of a summary narrative, critical performance expectations ratings, and a summary rating evaluation."
"Supervisor– A position or employee that accomplishes work through the direction of other employees, exercising both technical and administrative supervision over subordinates."
Supervisor Departure Appraisal – A performance appraisal prepared by the supervisor for each employee in the work unit when the supervisor departs his or her position.
The new supervisor will use the supervisor departure appraisal when preparing the employee’s next rating of record.
A supervisor departure appraisal from a permanent position becomes the rating of record if the departure occurs within the last 60 days of the employee’s appraisal period.
Temporary Promotion – A personnel action that changes the employee to a position at a higher grade on a temporary basis with a not-to-exceed date.
Term Appointments – An appointment of a period of more than one year but not more than four years to a position where the need for an employee’s services is not permanent.
"Total Evaluation Performance System (TEPS) – The employee performance evaluation system used to evaluate campus employees in Submission Processing, GS–08 and below, designated by the supervisor to be on a measured performance plan."
Transactional Processing Center (TPC) – Now known as the IRS Payroll Center.

"Valid Performance Appraisal – A performance appraisal that is completed on the Forms 6850-BU or NBU for employees covered by CJEs and on Forms 12450-A, 12450-B, or 12450-D for managers, management officials, or confidential management/program analysts."
A valid performance appraisal used as a rating of record contains the signatures of the rating official/rater and recommending/approving official and has been provided to the employee.
The performance appraisal must contain an overall summary rating level and a Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers rating and be based on the evaluation of actual job performance for the designated appraisal period.
"Within-Grade Increase (WIGI) – A WIGI is synonymous with the term ""step increase'"" used in 5 U.S.C."
"§ 5335, and means: (1) A periodic increase in an employee's rate of basic pay from one step of the grade of his or her position to the next higher step of that grade in accordance with 5 U.S.C."
"§ 5335, and 5 CFR Subpart D; or (2) For a GM employee (as defined in 5 CFR § 531.202), a periodic increase in an employee's rate of basic pay from his or her current rate to the next higher rate within the grade (as defined in 5 CFR § 531.404) in accordance with Pub."
L. No.
"103-89, section 4."
Within-Grade Increase (WIGI) Determination Appraisal – A performance appraisal prepared to support the decision to grant or deny a WIGI.
"If the employee’s most recent rating of record does not support the granting or denial of the WIGI, the supervisor must prepare a new rating of record to reflect the employee’s current performance."
See also Within-Grade Increase.
"Withholding of Within-Grade Increase (WIGI)– Occurs when a WIGI is due and the supervisor determines that the employee's summary performance appraisal is less than ""Fully Successful "" or equivalent."

Traci M. DiMartini
IRS Human Capital Officer

6.430.2.1 (10-28-2011)
Overview and Coverage
(1) This section describes the manner in which employees assigned to critical job elements (CJEs) are evaluated."
"(2) The supervisor should review IRM 6.430.1, Introduction to Performance Management, for background information before proceeding with this section."
"6.430.2.2 (10-28-2011)
Step 1: Planning Expectations
(1) On at least an annual basis, the supervisor and the employee will jointly discuss the assigned CJE performance plan and the expectations of performance against which the employee will be rated."
(2) It is the supervisor’s responsibility to ensure they administer the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Performance Management Program effectively and efficiently as it pertains to their employees.
"Also, the supervisor must keep current on performance management policies and processes through training courses and online resources."
(3) The Service developed the CJE performance plans to align with the IRS Balanced Measurement System and to simplify and standardize the performance standards to which employees are held accountable.
"(4) All employees have the following CJEs:

Employee Satisfaction-Employee Contribution

Customer Satisfaction-Knowledge

Customer Satisfaction-Application

Business Results-Quality

Business Results-Efficiency

Approved CJE performance plans may be found in the CJE Resource Center at https://irsgov.sharepoint.com/sites/EmployeeResources/SitePages/CareerOpportunities6.aspx?OR=Teams-HL&CT=1697136730253&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiIyNy8yMzA5MDExMjIyOSIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D.
"6.430.2.2.1 (06-12-2009)
Retention Standard for the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers
(1) The Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (RRA ’98), Section 1204, requires all IRS employees to be evaluated on the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
This requirement has been incorporated into a Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers that is the same for all employees.
"(2) For information on Discussing The Retention Standard for the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers, see IRM 6.430.2.2.5 and Exhibit 6.430.2-1."
"6.430.2.2.2 (10-28-2011)
Preparing for the Performance Appraisal Cycle
(1) The supervisor reviews the employee’s assigned standard position description (SPD), verifying that it accurately reflects the assigned duties."
"If it does not, the supervisor contacts the Human Capital Office (HCO), Position Management/Classification for assistance in identifying the appropriate SPD or developing a new one."
"(2) In most cases, the supervisor will start with an existing performance plan that is appropriate for the employee’s position."
"However, the supervisor may need to obtain a new performance plan if appropriate CJEs and performance aspects for the employee’s SPD do not exist."
"In the latter case, the supervisor contacts the business unit representative for guidance in obtaining the appropriate performance plan from the CJE Resource Center at https://irsgov.sharepoint.com/sites/EmployeeResources/SitePages/CareerOpportunities6.aspx?OR=Teams-HL&CT=1697136730253&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiIyNy8yMzA5MDExMjIyOSIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D."
"Note: See IRM 6.430.2.2.3, Developing or Revising CJE Performance Plans, and Exhibit 6.430.2-2 for the procedure that must be followed when developing CJEs."
"(3) The performance of bargaining unit and non-bargaining unit employees assigned to the following supervisory codes are evaluated against CJEs and performance aspects:

6 (Work leaders)

7 (Team leaders when leading employees on CJEs)

8 (All other positions)

The supervisory code is found on the employee’s SPD and controls the appropriate performance plan."
"(4) The supervisor must annotate the accuracy of the SPD on Form 6774, Receipt of Critical Job Elements and Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers Retention Standard, each year."
"If the SPD is no longer accurate, the supervisor should contact their business unit for further guidance."
"(5) The supervisor reviews the employee position specific CJE performance plan, which is composed of the CJEs and performance aspects describing the ""Meets,"" ""Exceeds,"" and ""Fails"" levels."
The CJE performance plans may be found in the CJE Resource Center at https://irsgov.sharepoint.com/sites/EmployeeResources/SitePages/CareerOpportunities6.aspx?OR=Teams-HL&CT=1697136730253&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiIyNy8yMzA5MDExMjIyOSIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D.
"(6) All CJE performance plans, including any new or revised performance plans, are approved and controlled by the HCO, Performance Management and Recognition office."
"6.430.2.2.3 (10-28-2011)
Developing or Revising CJE Performance Plans
(1) The CJE performance plans are developed by teams of subject matter experts (SMEs) using the following process:

The significant tasks for each position covered by the performance plan are identified by job analysis

The significant tasks are aligned with one of the following four balanced measures CJEs: Customer Satisfaction-Knowledge; Customer Satisfaction-Application; Business Results-Quality, or Business Results-Efficiency

No tasks are aligned to the Employee Satisfaction-Employee Contribution CJE since this CJE remains the same for all positions

The significant tasks aligned to a CJE are grouped into similar areas known as performance aspects

Performance levels for ""Meets,"" ""Exceeds,"" and ""Fails"" are developed for each performance aspect

(2) Business units must ensure the above process is followed when new CJE performance plans are developed or existing performance plans are revised."
"(3) Since CJE performance plans and performance aspects are intended to be as cross functional as possible, business units should coordinate development of a new or revised CJE performance plan with other divisions or functions that may use that plan."
(4) Business units must perform a complete job analysis when creating or modifying performance plans.
"This job analysis should include the following documentation:

A copy of the applicable SPDs

Major job requirements (should be highlighted in the body of the SPD and described in more detail on a separate sheet if the description in the SPD is inadequate)

The knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) that are required to perform the identified major job requirements and are important in evaluating candidates

An explanation of the linkage of the listed KSAs to the new or modified CJE performance aspects

The name, title, pay plan/series/grade, signature, and signature date for SMEs responsible for job analysis validity (two or more recommended)

The name, signature, and signature date of the reviewing human resources specialist

(5) The HCO, Performance Management and Recognition office will retain this written record including the job analysis and supporting documentation for as long as the CJE performance plan is current."
"(6) Business units must submit the new or revised performance plans to the HCO, Performance Management and Recognition office, for review and approval."
"(7) After approval, the HCO, Performance Management and Recognition office will provide a copy of the new or revised CJE performance plans covering bargaining unit employees to the HCO’s Labor/Employee Relations & Negotiations division for inclusion as part of the notice process as specified in the National Agreement (Document 11678)."
(8) The National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) will be given the opportunity to bargain impact and implementation before the new or revised CJE performance plans for bargaining unit employees are put into effect.
"(9) The HCO will forward the approved performance plans to Media and Publications, Publishing Services, to be put into the proper format and retained in the Electronic Publishing Product Catalog."
Note: See Exhibit 6.430.2-2 for more information on developing and documenting new or revised CJE performance plans and performance aspects.
"6.430.2.2.4 (01-01-2007)
Establishing the Appropriate CJE Performance Plan
(1) Establishing the appropriate CJE performance plan is a three-step process that includes:

Identifying the appropriate CJE performance plan

Sharing and discussing the CJE performance plan with the employee

Finalizing the CJE performance plan

6.430.2.2.4.1 (01-01-2007)
Identifying the Appropriate CJE Performance Plan
(1) Normally performance plans are developed and used for each of the positions in the same career ladder."
Career ladder positions are usually identified in the SPD and the vacancy announcement.
"(2) When employees at different grade levels of the same occupation (e.g., Revenue Agents, Management Analysts) share the same CJE performance plans, the supervisor should clearly convey the expectations for the employee’s specific grade level to each employee covered by the shared CJEs."
"6.430.2.2.4.2 (10-28-2011)
Sharing and Discussing the CJE Performance Plan
(1) Sharing the performance plan with the employee timely is critical."
"The supervisor’s assessment of an employee against their CJE performance plan serves as the basis for several actions, including: within-grade increase (WGI), promotion, recognizing and rewarding the employee, determining employee development needs, helping the employee improve, resolving performance deficiencies, or taking performance actions on an employee who continues to perform at a less than ""Fully Successful"" level."
"(2) The supervisor must meet with the employee within 30 days of the beginning of the employee’s appraisal period or when the employee is assigned to a new position that is expected to last at least 60 days or longer (e.g., temporary promotion, detail)."
This timeframe ensures the employee has sufficient time to understand the supervisor’s expectations for job performance and what performance is needed to achieve a specific rating.
"(3) The process of providing a CJE performance plan ensures the supervisor identifies, determines, and discusses with each employee current and future projects and timeframes to meet the Service’s mission."
"This is accomplished with the supervisor and employee discussing goals, objectives and the role the employee will play in meeting and or exceeding those goals and objectives."
"Assignments will relate to long-term and short-term Servicewide, division, and/or other organizational performance initiatives."
(4) The supervisor should discuss how the employee’s CJE performance plan links to the organizational work plans and balanced measures.
"Note: For additional information see IRM 1.5.2, Managing Statistics in a Balanced Measurement System, Uses of Section 1204 Statistics."
"(5) The supervisor should encourage the employee to come to the meeting with preliminary ideas of how the employee can contribute to the overall success of the IRS mission, strategic business goals, and business plan."
"(6) The supervisor and employee should discuss the organizational resources (e.g., funding, staffing, training) needed to support the accomplishment of each CJE."
"In most cases, no additional resources will be needed."
(7) The supervisor will determine the type of meeting to discuss the CJE performance plans.
"These meetings will be held as a group meeting, or as a one-on-one session."
"The supervisor will ensure the following items are available during the meeting:

Form 6774, Receipt of Critical Job Elements and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers Retention Standard

CJE performance plan

Business unit and group’s workplans as appropriate

(8) Each NTEU chapter whose bargaining unit members are attending the meeting should be provided reasonable notification and an opportunity to attend the meeting subject to the provisions of the National Agreement (Document 11678)."
"(9) In accordance with the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (RRA ’98), the supervisor must discuss the Retention Standard for the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers regardless of whether the employee has regular dealings with taxpayers."
"Note: See Exhibit 6.430.2-1 and on iManage, see the Retention Standard for Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers at https://irsgov.sharepoint.com/sites/iManage/SitePages/Employees-Evaluated-by-CJEs-Policy,-Guidance,-and-Memoranda.aspx?OR=Teams-HL&CT=1697137314414&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiIyNy8yMzA5MDExMjIyOSIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D."
"6.430.2.2.4.3 (10-05-2017)
Finalizing the CJE Performance Plan
(1) After discussing the performance plan with the employee, the supervisor and the employee sign Form 6774, Receipt of Critical Job Elements and Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers Retention Standard."
This form acknowledges receipt of the performance plan and Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers and discussion between the supervisor and the employee.
"(2) Annually, the supervisor and the employee must sign (or initial) and date Form 6774, Receipt of Critical Job Elements and Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers Retention Standard."
"Both managers and employees have the option of signing using the digital signature feature built into the form, but bargaining unit employees must also be given the option of signing the form manually and returning the hard copy to the manager."
The digital signature must display either the signer’s name or Standard Employee Identifier (SEID).
"If there is no digital signature that displays the signer’s name or SEID, the form must be signed manually."
"Note: Proxy signatures are not permitted on official performance documentation

(3) If the CJEs have not changed for a journey level or above employee, the supervisor need not meet with the employee regardless of bargaining unit status, but must communicate that the CJE performance plan remains the same for the CJEs have not changed for an appraisal period."
"Even if the supervisor does not hold the CJE meeting, the supervisor and the employee still must sign or initial and date a new Form 6774, Receipt of Critical Job Elements and Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers Retention Standard for the upcoming appraisal period."
"(4) When an employee returns to their permanent position during the same appraisal year following a temporary assignment, a new CJE performance plan is not required."
The supervisor for the employee's permanent position reinstates the performance plan previously in effect.
The time previously accrued under that performance plan counts toward the 60 day period for determining rating eligibility.
"(5) When an employee returns to duty from an absence that began during a previous appraisal period, the supervisor and employee must sign and date a new Form 6774, Receipt of Critical Job Elements and Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers Retention Standard."
"(6) The supervisor ensures the CJE performance plan, the signed Form 6774, Receipt of Critical Job Elements and Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers Retention Standard, and the employee’s SPD are filed in the Employee Performance Folder (EPF), and provides the employee with a copy of each."
"6.430.2.2.4.4 (10-28-2011)
Changes to the CJE Performance Plan or Employee Expectations
(1) Any changes made to an existing performance plan must be coordinated with the divisions or functions before final approval by the HCO, and must be submitted by the HCO to the National Headquarters, NTEU, as required by the National Agreement (Document 11678) for bargaining unit positions."
"(2) If the supervisor finds it necessary to make a minor change (such as when a task is inapplicable to a performance aspect) to the CJE performance plan during the appraisal period, the supervisor should discuss the changes with the employee as soon as feasible."
"These changes may be necessitated by organizational, environmental, personal, or other conditions."
"The supervisor must document the changes, file the original in the employee's EPF, and provide a copy to the employee."
(3) Changes in CJE performance plans or expectations against an established performance plan should be finalized at least 60 days before the end of the employee's appraisal period to avoid having to extend the appraisal period.
"6.430.2.2.5 (06-12-2009)
Discussing The Retention Standard for the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers
(1) The supervisor must discuss with the employee behaviors that allow the employee to meet the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers as well as, circumstances that may result in a determination that the employee does not meet the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers, and the potential impact of not meeting the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"Exhibit 6.430.2-1 provides examples of behavior that may result in a ""Met"" or ""Not Met"" rating."
See Exhibit 6.430.2-1.
"(2) Discussion of the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers will include:

An explanation of the requirements of the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers in relationship to the employee’s job expectations

The potential impacts of not meeting the standard

Avoidance of, use of the words ""deliberately"" or ""intentionally"" in describing behavior that does not meet the standard

An explanation of why infrequent lapses that are inadvertent or unavoidable will not result in a ""Not Met"" rating

An explanation of why a ""Met"" or ""Not Applicable"" rating will have no effect on the overall rating, ranking in merit promotion actions, or entitlement to performance awards

An explanation of why a ""Not Met"" rating for the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers will result in an ""Unacceptable"" overall rating."
"An ""Unacceptable"" overall rating makes the employee ineligible for a performance award, WGI, career ladder promotion, competition for promotion, or satisfactory completion of a probationary period, and may result in the employee’s removal from the position and/or the IRS."
"An ""Unacceptable"" overall rating will also adversely affect an employee’s retention standing in a reduction in force

Note: See Exhibit 6.430.2-1 and on iManage, see the Retention Standard for Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers at https://irsgov.sharepoint.com/sites/iManage/SitePages/Employees-Evaluated-by-CJEs-Policy,-Guidance,-and-Memoranda.aspx?OR=Teams-HL&CT=1697137314414&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiIyNy8yMzA5MDExMjIyOSIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D."
"6.430.2.3 (06-12-2009)
Step 2: Monitoring Progress
(1) During this step, the supervisor continuously monitors the employee’s progress against the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers and CJE performance plan and performance aspects, notes areas of significant achievement, identifies deficiencies, and initiates corrective actions."
"6.430.2.3.1 (10-28-2011)
Monitoring the Performance Plan
(1) The supervisor should monitor the employee's performance plan through the following:

Observes and documents employee behavior and performance during the appraisal period

Documents observations as they happen because recalling specific past behavior and performance is often difficult

Documents observations in sufficient detail to be understood by another supervisor."
"The manner in which performance is documented should be consistent for all employees and should not include comparing one employee to another

Focuses on specific actions the employee took to accomplish CJEs and does not evaluate personality traits

Cites performance or outcomes, not conduct or general impressions

Focuses on performance as it relates to the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers and progress toward achieving CJEs

Provides ongoing feedback and coaching to the employee

(2) Supervisors should avoid:

Delaying the documentation of an employee’s performance

Comparing employees against one another

Evaluating an employee’s personality traits

Citing the employee’s conduct or general impressions of the employee

(3) The supervisor may NOT use Records of Tax Enforcement Results (ROTERs) in monitoring progress against CJEs."
ROTERs do not convey how an employee performed in relation to requirements of the CJE performance plan.
"Note: For additional information on ROTERs, see IRM 1.5.2, Managing Statistics in a Balanced Measurement System, Uses of Section 1204 Statistics."
(4) The supervisor should keep performance data organized in the EPF.
All documents used in formulating an evaluation must be shared with the employee prior to placing it in the employee’s EPF.
Supervisors must share any written evaluative recordation with bargaining unit employees within time periods established in the National Agreement (Document 11678).
"If not, it cannot be used as evaluative recordation."
"Note: For additional information on the EPF, see IRM 6.430.2.3.5."
"6.430.2.3.2 (10-28-2011)
Conducting Progress Reviews
(1) The supervisor observes the employee’s performance on a regular basis throughout the employee’s appraisal period."
"(2) At a minimum, the supervisor must conduct a mandatory mid-year progress review on the requirements of the CJE performance plan."
The mid-year progress review is a review of the employee’s work based on observation of behaviors related to the CJE performance plan for the position.
The mid-year progress review generally occurs at the mid point of the appraisal period and must include a discussion on progress in meeting expectations (CJEs and the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers).
"While the supervisor should, at a minimum, discuss each performance aspect whose performance has changed from the previous rating of record, there is no requirement to assign a ""Meets,"" ""Exceeds,"" or ""Fails"" rating to each performance aspect."
"In addition, the supervisor is not required to provide numerical ratings for the CJEs or the overall rating during the mid-year progress review."
"(3) The supervisor should provide meaningful feedback, relating it specifically to CJEs, opportunities for improvement, and the manner in which progress is being achieved."
"The supervisor should also cite outcomes and specific examples and offer feedback when it can be discussed and when it is most useful, that is as soon as the work is completed or before the employee will be doing a similar task."
The supervisor should also coach the employee in ways to improve performance.
The supervisor should combine formal and informal feedback often throughout the appraisal period to highlight changes in performance and next steps.
Monthly or quarterly one-on-one sessions may be appropriate in addition to the mandatory mid-year progress review.
(4) The supervisor should combine formal and informal feedback often throughout the appraisal period to highlight changes in performance and next steps.
Monthly or quarterly one-on-one sessions may be appropriate in addition to the mandatory mid-year progress review.
(5) All performance recordations and discussions must be documented and shared with the employee prior to being filed in the EPF.
Any employee comments concerning the recordations must also be filed in the EPF.
The date the progress review was conducted should be noted on the performance appraisal form.
Supervisors must share any written progress reviews with bargaining unit employees within time periods established in the National Agreement (Document 11678).
"If not, they cannot be used as evaluative recordation."
"(6) If the supervisor notes that an employee’s performance has declined from the previous appraisal period, the supervisor must note it and conduct a counseling session with the employee."
"Although performance feedback is always encouraged, supervisors are not required to notify a non bargaining unit employee prior to lowering the employee's average CJE score from the previous annual rating."
"Note: For more information concerning a decrease in performance of an employee, see Acknowledging Decreased Work Performance in IRM 6.430.2.3.3."
"(7) Generally, employees may not grieve progress reviews until they are used in the annual rating of record."
This is because the supervisor may change their evaluation of performance before the end of the appraisal period and the performance documentation may not be used in the performance appraisal.
Grievances filed before that time would be premature.
"However, an employee may attach documentation regarding matters of concern to their progress review."
Exception: A bargaining unit employee may grieve a mid-year progress review or other evaluation recordation if that recordation has been used by management as the basis for denying the employee a benefit such as the ability to work overtime or continue on an alternative work schedule (AWS).
"6.430.2.3.3 (01-01-2007)
Acknowledging Decreased Work Performance
(1) It is the supervisor’s responsibility to inform the employee whenever a decrease in work performance is observed either from the prior year’s appraisal or from the mid-year progress review."
"A decrease in performance necessitating supervisory involvement normally refers to the decline of one or more rating levels (i.e.,"" Exceeds Fully Successful"" to"" Fully Successful"")."
"In this event, the following steps may be taken:

Identify any area or areas of decreased performance that are related to the CJEs and performance aspects of the employee’s performance plan

Discuss with the employee the decrease in performance or any performance deficiencies identified, including the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers

Fully document, in writing, the specific examples of decreased performance and the associated aspects that were observed and any discussions with the employee about them."
"This documentation should be filed in the employee’s EPF

Discuss recommendations for improved work performance with the employee."
"This may include identifying and providing supplemental training or reading, on-the-job training, and other developmental activities, as appropriate, to help improve employee performance, especially when performance falls below the ""Meets"" level in one or more aspects

Continue to monitor the employee’s work performance until the work performance improves."
"Frequently review and discuss work performance with the employee

If performance is below the ""Fully Successful"" level and the employee does not improve their performance, continue to hold progress reviews to provide the employee an opportunity to raise the level of their work performance

Note: Employees who are rated below ""Fully Successful ""are not eligible for WGI."
"See IRM 6.430.2.5.4, Within-Grade Increase (WGI) Determination, for more information and for more information on WGI determinations for bargaining unit employees, see the National Agreement (Document 11678)."
"6.430.2.3.4 (10-28-2011)
Marginal and Unacceptable Performance
(1) Supervisors must provide assistance to employees at any time during the appraisal period that performance is determined to be ""Minimally Successful"" or ""Unacceptable"" in one or more CJEs or the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"(2) The supervisor must consult with their servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office regarding any performance rating of ""Unacceptable"" or ""Minimally Successful"" to ensure that all parties understand the implications of failing to improve."
"(3) Employees who do not meet the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers, or are performing below ""Minimally Successful"" in any of the CJEs should be counseled as early as possible in the appraisal period."
"Failure to improve or to sustain at least a"" Minimally Successful"" rating could impact an employee’s ability to remain in their position."
"(4) Before a supervisor begins the formal process of taking a performance based action, the supervisor needs to be aware that they have certain options."
"The law provides for two different processes for taking performance based actions:

If a performance based action is taken under 5 CFR Part 432, a formal opportunity to improve is required

If a performance based action is taken under the adverse action procedures of 5 CFR Part 752, an opportunity period is not required

Note: Regardless of the process used, the supervisor must contact the servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office for assistance."
"(5) ""Unacceptable"" ratings must be reviewed and approved by an official higher than the rating official."
"(6) When an employee's performance fails to meet established performance expectations at an acceptable level (i.e., ""Minimally Successful"") in one or more CJEs or the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers, the supervisor must notify the employee in writing."
"This notice must advise the employee of the following:

That their performance is unacceptable

Which CJE(s) are not being performed in an acceptable manner

What is required to perform at the rating level of ""Fully Successful"" or above

Any assistance that will be provided to the employee

What the reasonable period to demonstrate acceptable performance will be

Failure to perform at an acceptable performance level may result in removal, reduction in grade, withholding of a WGI, or reassignment depending upon the performance factors

(7) The employee must be provided a minimum of 60 days during which to raise their work performance to an acceptable level."
"While a rating of record showing the ""Unacceptable"" performance is not required at this time, the supervisor must communicate to the employee in writing the specifics for the ""Unacceptable"" rating."
"(8) If an employee’s performance does not improve to an acceptable level (i.e., Minimally Successful), an adverse action may result (e.g., reduction in grade, reassignment, or removal)."
The supervisor must contact the servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office before initiating any formal performance based action.
"Note: For additional information, see IRM 6.432.1, Addressing Poor Performance."
"(9) If the employee demonstrates acceptable performance during the opportunity period, the rating official retains the notice of unacceptable performance in the EPF for one year from the date the opportunity period became effective."
"In accordance with 5 USC Section 4303(d) if, because of performance improvement by the employee during the notice period, the employee is not reduced in grade or removed, and the employee's performance continues to be acceptable for one year from the date of the advance written notice, any entry or other notation of the unacceptable performance for which the action was proposed must be removed from any record, manual and automated, relating to the employee

The rating official is responsible for removing and destroying such records from the EPF and for initiating removal from the Service’s automated personnel records

(10) Saving Provision – Any administrative action initiated (e.g., an action taken against ""Unacceptable"" employees under 5 USC Section 4303) must continue to be processed consistent with the procedures and requirements of the program in effect when the action was initiated."
"(11) A rating of ""Minimally Successful"" or ""Unacceptable"" will also lead to the employee’s ineligibility to receive a WGI, career ladder promotion, or to complete their probationary period."
"Note: See IRM 6.531.1, Pay Under the General Schedule and IRS Payband System, for more information."
"6.430.2.3.5 (10-28-2011)
Employee Performance File (EPF)
(1) The EPF is a system consisting of all performance ratings and other performance-related records maintained on an employee in accordance with 5 CFR Part 293, Subpart D.

(2) Management is responsible for creating records concerning employee performance and maintaining them in accordance with the Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act regulations."
"(3) At a minimum, the EPF should contain forms and documents which:

Record and support the performance appraisal and individual performance plans

Are used by the supervisor to recommend a personnel action affecting an employee when the basis for the action is performance related

Are furnished in support of recommended actions and the agency’s final decision on the matter

Note: Other types of documents and forms may include Individual Development Plans (IDPs), recommendations for training that are performance-related, and copies of supervisory counseling session records resulting in performance based personnel actions

(4) The following documents must be maintained for four years:

Form 6850-BU, Bargaining Unit Performance Appraisal and Recognition Election; Form 6850-NBU, Non Bargaining Unit Performance Appraisal; or previous editions

The CJE performance plan document

Progress review(s) documentation

Employee self-assessments

Documented workload reviews, case file reviews, and job visitations

Any other documentation that supports the performance rating

Form 6774, Receipt for Critical Job Elements and Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers Retention Standard

(5) The supervisor must keep performance records in the EPF as long as necessary, if needed in connection with a grievance, appeal, or judicial proceeding."
"(6) For employees who are permanently changing positions within the IRS, the supervisor will ensure the employee’s entire EPF is forwarded to the gaining supervisor."
"(7) For employees who are accepting outside employment and leaving the IRS, who are accepting employment with another government agency, or who are resigning or retiring from IRS the supervisor must remove all of the ratings of record completed within the last four years from the separating employee’s EPF, attach these ratings of record to Form 3210, Document Transmittal, and forward the package to the following address:

Internal Revenue Service - OPF Consolidation Site
440 Space Center Drive
Lee's Summit, MO 64064
(8) The National Archives and Records Administration staff will ensure the ratings of record with appropriate CJE performance plan documents are filed in the Official Personnel Folder (OPF) before being sent to the Federal Records Center, if the employee resigns or to the gaining agency if the employee transfers."
"(9) Supervisors must destroy any remaining performance related documents unless such records are needed in connection with a grievance, appeal, or judicial proceeding."
"6.430.2.4 (01-01-2007)
Step 3: Evaluating Performance
(1) During this step, the supervisor completes the employee’s performance appraisal and conducts a performance appraisal meeting with the employee."
"6.430.2.4.1 (10-28-2011)
The Annual Performance Appraisal Process
(1) All employees who have served the minimum appraisal period of 60 calendar days are entitled to an annual performance appraisal that becomes the rating of record."
(2) Permanent supervisors complete the annual performance appraisals for employees under their authority.
(3) Employees who are temporarily promoted or detailed to a supervisory position have the authority to complete the annual performance appraisals for employees under their supervision.
There is no minimum period of time required for this authority.
"(4) The employee’s performance must have been observed a minimum of 60 days in the appraisal period by any supervisor who was responsible for assigning, reviewing, and evaluating the employee's work."
"However, it is not necessary for the employee's current supervisor to have observed the employee’s performance under a signed performance plan for 60 days or more."
"(5) The supervisor should consider the following when evaluating performance for an annual appraisal:

Position description

CJE performance plan (CJEs and performance aspects)

Mid-year and other progress reviews

Employee’s work products (management briefings, memos)

Employee’s self-assessment

Feedback from coworkers, taxpayers, and other customers

Team assignments and contributions to work group

Special achievements

Note: For more information on the various reasons for performance appraisals, see Exhibit 6.430.2-3."
"6.430.2.4.2 (01-01-2007)
Appraisal Period
(1) Bargaining unit and non bargaining unit employees covered by CJE performance plans are evaluated in accordance with a schedule based on the employee’s last digit of their Social Security Number (SSN)."
The schedule for appraisal periods and due dates is shown in the National Agreement (Document 11678).
"(2) In addition, an appraisal period will begin each time an employee is assigned to a new position for at least 60 days (e.g., temporary promotions, details, projects, or task forces) or issued a new CJE performance plan."
"(3) If the employee has not been observed by the current or another supervisor for 60 days on their performance plan at the time the employee's annual rating is due, the supervisor must:

Ensure that a performance plan has been issued

Ensure that the employee has signed the performance plan

Postpone any rating until the employee’s performance has been observed for a minimum of 60 days

Use the employee’s existing rating of record as the current rating of record until the new appraisal is prepared

(4) A new performance plan is not required for an employee returning to their permanent position following a temporary personnel action if the employee is returning during the same appraisal cycle."
"In this case, the supervisor of the employee’s permanent position may reinstate the performance plan previously in effect rather than complete a new performance plan."
The time previously accrued under the original performance plan would count toward the 60 day period for rating eligibility.
"6.430.2.4.2.1 (10-28-2011)
Performance Appraisal Due Dates
(1) The supervisor must complete the employee's annual appraisal for both bargaining unit and non bargaining unit employees within the scheduled time limits shown in the National Agreement (Document 11678), provided the employee has been observed for 60 days or more against their signed performance plan during the appraisal period."
Note: See Exhibit 6.430.2-4 for more information on performance appraisal due dates.
(2) The supervisor must follow their business unit’s procedures for ensuring that the employee’s annual appraisal is entered into the Service’s automated performance appraisal system.
(3) Departure appraisals are required for temporary assignments of 60 days or more during the appraisal period.
These appraisals should be completed within 30 days after the employee completes the temporary assignment and should be forwarded to the supervisor responsible for assigning the overall rating.
"Note: For more information concerning departure appraisals, see the discussion on departure appraisals in IRM 6.430.2.5.1, IRM 6.430.5, and Exhibit 6.430.2-4."
"6.430.2.4.2.2 (10-28-2011)
Extension of the Appraisal Period
(1) When an annual rating of record cannot be prepared at the specified time, the appraisal period shall be extended for the minimum appraisal period of 60 days to meet the conditions necessary to complete a rating of record."
"(2) To extend the appraisal period, the employee must be in work status on the appraisal period ending date and have some performance under a signed performance plan during the appraisal year."
The supervisor must decide to extend the employee’s appraisal year on or before the employee’s appraisal period ending date.
"(3) The employee is ""Not Ratable"" if all of the following conditions exist:

The employee has less than 60 days performance under a signed performance plan during the appraisal year

The employee’s appraisal period has ended

The employee is not in work status on the appraisal period ending date

Note: See IRM 6.430.2.5.5 for more information on ""Not Ratable"" determinations."
"(4) Examples of extension situations include but are not limited to:

To meet the 60 day minimum performance appraisal period."
For non bargaining unit employees only - The supervisor should not extend the appraisal period of a newly-hired NBU employee solely to provide the employee with a rating of record.
"In that event, the employee is ""Not Ratable"" for the appraisal period."
"Note: For more information on ""Not Ratable"" determinations, see IRM 6.430.2.5.5."
"To provide a new supervisor an opportunity to observe an employee’s performance against current requirements when information concerning the employee’s past performance is not available

To appraise an employee whose overall performance has been less than acceptable due to personal circumstances, (e.g., extended illness or other circumstances) and there is evidence of improvement in the employee’s performance

To provide a performance improvement period to an employee who was previously notified of failure to meet one or more performance standards

(5) An extension of the appraisal period will not affect the next appraisal ""period covered"" ending date; however, the starting date of the next appraisal period begins after the extension ends."
"(6) When the appraisal period is extended, the supervisor shall immediately inform the employee and the reviewing official."
(7) The supervisor must follow their business unit’s procedures for ensuring that the employee’s annual appraisal is entered into the Service’s automated performance appraisal system after the extended appraisal period is completed and the rating of record is assigned.
"6.430.2.4.2.3 (01-01-2007)
Dates on the Performance Appraisal Form
(1) The supervisor should accurately annotate the appraisal period on the appraisal form."
"(2) The date that the annual appraisal period ends will normally be the ""to"" date under period covered on the performance agreement form."
"(3) If an employee's departure from a permanent position is within 60 days from the date the appraisal period ends, the ""to"" date should reflect the actual departure date since that date reflects the date the employee actually departed their position."
(4) The entire appraisal period including any extensions necessary should be indicated under the period covered.
"6.430.2.4.3 (06-12-2009)
Employees Serving Probationary Periods
(1) The supervisor should begin monitoring probationary employees immediately to determine if they are able to perform the work, and are otherwise suited for retention in their position."
"Although formal performance improvement plans are not required for probationary employees, the supervisor should provide the probationary employees who are not meeting their CJE performance plan with sufficient information to help them understand how they are failing and how they can improve."
(2) Probationary employees are included in the appraisal schedule shown in the National Agreement (Document 11678).
Their scheduled annual appraisal period is based on the last digit of their SSN.
"If the probationary employee has at least 60 days under a signed performance plan (Form 6774, Receipt of Critical Job Elements and Retention Standard) at the time the annual rating is due, the supervisor must prepare a Form 6850-BU or Form 6850-NBU even if the employee has not been in the position for a full year."
"(3) If the probationary employee's performance does not improve, then the supervisor should immediately begin action to terminate the employee from the position and/or Federal service."
"(4) Supervisors should consult with the servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office regarding any performance rating of ""Minimally Successful"" or ""Unacceptable"" to ensure that all parties understand the implications of failing to improve."
"(5) A rating of ""Fully Successful"" or higher, rendered early during the probationary period does not preclude a subsequent decision that the employee is not performing at the expected level, or is otherwise unsuitable to be retained."
"However, the supervisor should provide specific examples of how performance deteriorated after the rating was assigned if the decision to remove during probation is for unacceptable performance."
"6.430.2.4.4 (01-01-2007)
Minimum Appraisal Period for Full Time Union Representatives
(1) See the National Agreement (Document 11678) for more information."
"6.430.2.4.5 (10-15-2010)
Self-Assessments
(1) Self-assessments are narrative descriptions or lists of accomplishments that the employee develops for the annual rating to describe their realization of goals, objectives, achievements, and significant accomplishments or challenges during the specified appraisal period."
(2) An effective self-assessment describes the specific actions taken by the employee to accomplish work requirements identified by the CJE performance plan and the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers.
(3) Bargaining unit employees are not required to submit a self-assessment but should be encouraged to do so.
"(4) Within the last 30 days of the appraisal period, the supervisor should ask the employee to prepare a self-assessment."
"(5) A bargaining unit employee must be given up to four hours of official time to prepare a self-assessment, if the employee requests it."
This requirement has not been extended to non bargaining unit employees.
(6) Bargaining unit employees should submit their self-assessment to their immediate supervisor no later than the last workday of their appraisal cycle.
(7) Non bargaining unit employees should submit their self-assessment to their immediate supervisor by the date requested by their supervisor.
(8) The supervisor must consider the employee’s self-assessment when preparing the employee’s annual appraisal.
"(9) If the employee prepares a self-assessment, it should be attached to the employee’s revalidated annual appraisal for all purposes."
(10) Self-assessments are limited to four pages regardless of the format chosen.
"Employees may (but are not required to) use Form 13335, Performance Appraisal Self-Assessment Form in preparing and submitting a self-assessment."
Note: More information on writing self-assessments is found in the Performance Appraisal Self-Assessment Tutorial at https://publish.no.irs.gov/cat12.cgi?request=CAT2&itemtyp=D&itemb=11948&items=%2a.
"6.430.2.4.5.1 (01-01-2007)
Using ROTERs in Self-Assessments
(1) Using Records of Tax Enforcement Results (ROTERs) in self-assessments does not violate either Section 1204 of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 or the 26 CFR Part 801."
"(2) It is a violation of Section 1204, however, if a supervisor uses the ROTERs information from the employee’s self-assessment when evaluating the employee’s performance."
"(3) To dispel even the appearance of impropriety, employees should be encouraged to avoid using ROTERs in self-assessments."
"(4) For non bargaining unit employees only: If a non bargaining unit employee submits a self-assessment with ROTERs, it should be returned to the employee for removal of the ROTERs."
"Note: For additional information on ROTERs, see IRM 1.5.2, Managing Statistics in a Balanced Measurement System, Uses of Section 1204 Statistics."
"6.430.2.4.6 (10-28-2011)
Completing Appraisal Narratives
(1) Narratives can reinforce corporate values, particularly customer service."
It is beneficial to comment on significant accomplishments and narratives need to accurately reflect the employee’s performance for the appraisal period.
"(2) Normally, performance appraisal narratives should not exceed two single-spaced, typed pages."
There are situations when a narrative may not be required as discussed further in this section.
"(3) All documentation must be reviewed, considered, and summarized for work performed during the appraisal period."
"These documents support numerical ratings assigned, possible performance awards, merit promotion opportunities, and help to identify continuing educational needs."
(4) Supervisors should review each performance aspect and prepare a written narrative describing the level of performance for each applicable performance aspect.
The supervisor should write the narrative before assigning levels to performance aspects.
(5) The narrative should contain brief highlights of an employee’s performance for a specified appraisal period.
It must describe performance as it relates to the employee’s CJEs and for every performance aspect observed and serves as the basis for the overall rating.
"(6) Well-written narratives contain specific goals and objectives, examples of achievements, significant accomplishments and/or, if necessary, performance shortfalls of measurable and observable performance during the appraisal period."
"They should:

Be concise, but descriptive enough to give the next level reviewer an accurate picture of the strengths, development needs, and accomplishments of the employee in each CJE

Focus on what’s important for that particular job and the CJEs

Be clear about whether the employee ""Exceeds,"" ""Meets,"" or ""Fails"" each individual performance aspect

Ensure each CJE narrative is consistent with the focus of the CJE outlined in the performance plan

(7) Narratives must NOT contain Records of Tax Enforcement Results (ROTERs)."
"For additional information, see IRM 1.5.2, Managing Statistics in a Balanced Measurement System, Uses of Section 1204 Statistics."
(8) Narratives are permanent records that become part of the performance appraisal.
"(9) Once completed, the narratives must be attached to the performance appraisal form (Form 6850-BU or Form 6850-NBU)."
"6.430.2.4.6.1 (01-01-2007)
Determining the Requirement for a Narrative
(1) Narratives are required under the following situations:

When an employee is appraised on a new performance plan."
"In the merit promotion competitive process when a narrative was not completed at the time the employee received their annual rating, then the supervisor must write a narrative at the time the employee applies for a job."
If the supervisor lowers the rating of a CJE from the prior year's appraisal.
"For any CJE rated at the ""Fully Successful"" level or below."
"For a rating of ""Not Met"" in the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"If ""Not Applicable"" (N/A) is provided in lieu of a score for a performance aspect or CJE due to a lack of an opportunity to perform or observe performance in that area, the circumstances must be noted."
"(2) Narratives are not required under the following situations:

The employee is on the same performance plan as the prior year and the supervisor awards a ""4 ""or ""5"" in a CJE, and that same score or a lower score was awarded the prior performance appraisal period

The employee is applying through merit promotion for GS-8 and below positions in Submission Processing, Accounts Management, and Compliance Services

Employees in Submission Processing who receive measured ratings in quality and quantity provided by the Total Evaluation Performance System (TEPS)

(3) If the supervisor revalidates the prior year’s appraisal, the prior year’s narratives are still attached to the appraisal form and these narratives may be used for merit promotion purposes."
"If the employee applies for merit promotion and one or more CJE does not have a narrative, the supervisor must prepare new narratives for those CJEs that reflect performance for the appraisal period covered by the annual rating."
"Note: For more information about revalidated appraisals, see IRM 6.430.2.4.11."
"6.430.2.4.7 (01-01-2007)
Rating Performance Against The Retention Standard for the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers
(1) The supervisor must determine whether the employee has performed duties with potential impact on taxpayer issues or outcomes during the appraisal period."
"(2) If the employee has performed such duties, the supervisor must determine whether the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers has been ""Met."""
"(3) If a rating of ""Not Met"" is proposed, the supervisor must contact their servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office for guidance on developing a Performance Improvement Plan."
"Failure of the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers will result in an Overall Rating of ""Unacceptable."""
"(4) If the employee has not performed such duties the supervisor must check ""Not Applicable"" for the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers on Form 6850-BU and Form 6850-NBU."
"6.430.2.4.8 (01-01-2007)
Rating Performance Aspects
(1) Annual appraisals are completed on Form 6850-BU."
The supervisor lists each performance aspect under the appropriate CJE on the Form 6850-BU or Form 6850-NBU.
"(2) The supervisor evaluates the employee’s performance in each performance aspect and rates each aspect as ""Exceeds,"", ""Meets,"" or ""Fails""."
"(3) If the supervisor has not observed the employee’s performance in a performance aspect for the mandatory minimum time required or such information is not available from other supervisors for the minimum time required, the supervisor assigns a rating of ""Not Applicable""."
"Instances of ""Not Applicable"" should be rare and must be documented in the attached appraisal narrative."
"The ""Not Applicable"" designation should not be used when the employee has failed to perform the required tasks or duties because of performance restrictions based on safety, security, or integrity issues."
(4) The supervisor’s determination of the employee’s level of performance in each aspect determines the employee’s subsequent CJE score and overall rating.
"(5) The supervisor must always use careful judgment in determining if an employee has a rating of ""Exceeds,"" ""Meets,"" or ""Fails,"" in each performance aspect of the CJE."
"Normally, the supervisor should not allow one incident to unduly influence the rating of an aspect."
"In assigning the performance level, supervisors should consider the quality, quantity, and complexity of the assignment or task in relationship with the employee’s grade and skill level."
"(6) The employee must consistently perform all applicable tasks (performance standards) listed at the ""Exceeds"" rating level, including any additional tasks not found in the ""Meets"" level, in order to receive a rating of ""Exceeds"" for that aspect."
"6.430.2.4.9 (10-28-2011)
Rating CJEs
(1) The rating for each CJE will be based upon the ratings of all observed performance aspects of the CJE, using the following required scale:

CJE Rating

Numerical Scale

Definition

Outstanding

5

Exceeds all performance aspects of the CJE."
"Exceeds Fully Successful

4

Exceeds more than half of the performance aspects of the CJE and meets the other performance aspects."
"Fully Successful

3

Meets all of the performance aspects."
"Minimally Successful

2

Fails one performance aspect."
"Unacceptable

1

Fails two (2) or more performance aspects."
"Not Applicable

N/A

The supervisor has not observed performance of the duties/responsibilities reflected by the CJEs."
(2) The numerical scale above for each CJE is used to determine the average CJE score.
"While the average CJE score has no direct relationship to the overall rating, it is used as the basis for calculating bargaining unit performance awards."
"Note: CJEs deemed ""Not Applicable"" are excluded from the average CJE score calculation."
"6.430.2.4.10 (10-28-2011)
The Overall Rating
(1) Each annual performance appraisal will include an overall rating, as follows:

Overall Rating

Definition

Outstanding

Employee is rated ""Outstanding"" in more than half of the CJEs and ""Exceeds Fully Successful"" in the remainder of the CJEs, and receives a ""Met"" on the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"Exceeds Fully Successful

Employee is rated ""Exceeds Fully Successful"" or above in more than half of the CJEs and ""Fully Successful"" in the remainder of the CJEs, and receives a ""Met"" on the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"Fully Successful

Employee is rated ""Fully Successful"" or above in all of the CJEs, and receives a ""Met"" on the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"Minimally Successful

Employee is rated ""Minimally Successful"" in one or more CJEs but not ""Unacceptable"" in any CJE, and receives a ""Met"" on the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"Unacceptable

Employee is rated ""Unacceptable"" in one or more CJEs or receives a ""'Not Met'"" on the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"(2) If the employee has insufficient performance during the appraisal period to be assigned a rating of record, the employee will be designated ""Not Ratable ""for that period."
"Note: For additional information on Not Ratable determinations, see IRM 6.430.2.5.5

."
"(3) Overall ratings should be assigned at the end of the appraisal period for the annual performance appraisal and for other types of performance appraisals that become the employee’s rating of record, such as a departure appraisal within the last 60 days of the appraisal period."
(4) Supervisors should not assign overall ratings for other types of appraisals that do not become an employee’s rating of record.
Note: See Exhibit 6.430.2-3 for examples of other types of performance appraisals that may become ratings of record.
(5) The overall rating provides one rating for the combined performance against the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers and the CJEs and becomes the employee's rating of record.
(6) The supervisor should only assign the overall rating at the end of the appraisal period for an employee who is on a permanent assignment or who is on a temporary promotion at the end of the employee’s appraisal period and meets the conditions specified in IRM 6.430.5.3(2).
Note: See IRM 6.430.5 for more information about performance appraisals for temporary assignments.
(7) It is not necessary for the supervisor to have observed the employee’s performance under a signed performance agreement for 60 days or more.
"However, the employee’s performance must have been observed by at least one other supervisor under a signed agreement for a minimum of 60 days within the appraisal period."
"In rare cases, it may be necessary to extend the appraisal period until the minimum 60 days has been met."
(8) The reviewing official has the final authority on whether to approve the overall rating.
"6.430.2.4.11 (12-20-2023)
Revalidated Annual Appraisals
(1) Revalidated annual appraisals are not permitted for non-bargaining unit employees."
(2) The bargaining unit revalidation process requires the supervisor to conduct the same thorough review and evaluative process to determine if the rating of record remains exactly the same.
"(3) To revalidate an employee’s annual rating, the supervisor must determine that the employee would receive a rating of record for the current performance rating period identical to the rating of record for the previous period."
"Identical means that the ratings for the performance aspects, CJEs, and overall rating have not changed."
Note: OPM regulations do not permit the issuance of a rating of record that assumes a level of performance by an employee without an actual evaluation of that employee's performance.
"(4) To receive a revalidated appraisal, the employee must be at the journey level or above and at least in the second year of their position."
(5) The supervisor must advise the employee before revalidating an appraisal.
(6) The supervisor may revalidate a previous year’s annual rating even if the supervisor did not prepare the prior appraisal.
"(7) When revalidating an appraisal, supervisors are also revalidating the Retention Standard rating from the previous rating of record."
(8) The narratives that accompanied the previous appraisal being revalidated must be considered valid and must remain a component of the revalidated performance appraisal.
"If the supervisor wants to update the narrative, they must prepare a new appraisal instead of revalidating."
(9) The employee’s self-assessment is attached to the revalidated appraisal for all purposes.
"If the supervisor objects to the accuracy of a self-assessment, the supervisor may prepare a new appraisal with narratives."
If the supervisor decides not prepare a new appraisal it does not indicate they agree with the employee’s self–assessment.
(10) The supervisor must still conduct a performance discussion with the employee.
(11) A supervisor may revalidate a rating of record indefinitely for bargaining unit employees only.
"6.430.2.5 (10-28-2011)
Additional Reasons for Performance Appraisals
(1) Although the employee’s annual appraisal that becomes the employee’s rating of record is the most commonly given appraisal, other performance appraisals may be issued for specific circumstances."
(2) Some of these other performance appraisals may also be used as the employee’s rating of record as described below.
"Note: See Exhibit 6.430.2-3 for more information on additional reasons for performance appraisals, and IRM 6.430.5 for more information concerning performance appraisal requirements for temporary assignments."
"6.430.2.5.1 (10-28-2011)
Departure Appraisals
(1) A departure appraisal is a type of appraisal prepared when either the supervisor or employee moves from a permanent or temporary assignment to another permanent or temporary assignment."
(2) The employee's performance must have been observed under a signed performance plan for at least 60 days.
"(3) Each CJE is rated; however, an overall rating is not assigned unless the employee departs their position within 60 days of the end of the appraisal period or the supervisor departs their position within 60 days of the end of the employee’s appraisal period and the departure appraisal becomes the rating of record as discussed below."
"(4) Reasons for departure appraisals:

Supervisor departure - If a supervisor permanently departs their position, a departure appraisal must be prepared for all of the employees in the supervisor’s work unit."
The new supervisor will use this departure appraisal to prepare the employee’s rating of record when the employee’s appraisal period ends.
"Supervisor departure (last 60 days of the employee's appraisal period) - If a supervisor permanently departs their position during the last 60 days of the employee's appraisal period, the departure appraisal becomes the employee's rating of record."
The supervisor should assign an overall rating of record for these departure appraisals since the appraisal will be used as the rating of record.
"If a supervisor temporarily departs for a position during the last 60 days of the employee's appraisal period, that supervisor will be responsible for preparing the rating of record."
"Employee departure - If an employee departs their position with more than 60 days remaining in the appraisal period, the supervisor must prepare a departure appraisal for that employee."
The employee’s new supervisor will consider the departure appraisal when preparing the employee's next rating of record.
"Employee departure (last 60 days of appraisal period) - If the employee departs their position within the last 60 days of the employee’s appraisal period, the departure appraisal becomes the employee's rating of record."
The supervisor should assign an overall rating for these departure appraisals since the appraisal will be used as the rating of record.
"(5) If a supervisor is assigned to a new organization and the employee accompanies the supervisor to the new organization and will be occupying the same position, a departure rating is not required."
(6) The supervisor must sign the departure appraisal and provide a copy to the employee for the employee’s signature.
The reviewing official’s signature is not required unless the departure appraisal will become the employee’s rating of record.
"(7) All departure appraisals must either be sent to the employee’s new office (with the employee’s EPF), if the employee is changing positions, or be placed in the employee’s EPF when the supervisor changes positions."
(8) The rating official should consider all departure appraisals as input for preparation of the employee’s annual rating of record.
(9) Departure appraisals are not required for employees leaving the IRS and not going to other Federal employment.
"For example, departure appraisals are not required for employees who resign or retire."
(10) Departure appraisals are required for employees leaving the IRS for other Federal employment through transfer to other Federal agencies or reassignment to other Treasury bureaus and for employees accepting new appointments with the IRS or other Federal agencies.
"6.430.2.5.2 (06-12-2009)
Merit Promotion Appraisals (MPA)
(1) The employee's most recent rating of record within the last four years will be used for merit promotion in nearly all cases."
(2) A supervisor may prepare a new performance appraisal for merit promotion purposes when the employee is newly hired or has returned to duty after a lengthy absence and has no rating of record on file.
"To be provided a MPA after a lengthy absence, the employee must not have had at least 60 days of performance under a signed performance plan for the most recently completed appraisal period."
The newly hired employee must have been on board for at least 90 days after an initial appointment.
"In either instance, the employee must meet the minimum appraisal period requirements for the current appraisal period as specified in IRM 6.430.2.4.2."
(3) A MPA cannot be used as the employee's rating of record and is valid for all merit promotion actions until the employee receives an annual rating of record.
"(4) Since a MPA cannot become a rating of record, no reviewing official signature is required and no overall rating is assigned."
"(5) An employee who has served 90 days on a competitive appointment but has not served 60 cumulative days under a signed performance plan (e.g., seasonal employee or a full time union official) is considered ""Not Ratable"" for merit promotion purposes."
"These ""Not Ratable"" employees cannot receive any type of performance appraisal for merit promotion, even a ""presumptive"" Fully Successful appraisal."
"Employment offices cannot accept ""presumptive"" Fully Successful appraisals for merit promotion."
Note: See IRM 6.430.2.5.7 for more information on presumptive ratings.
"(6) The supervisor must use the following procedures to document that the employee is ""Not Ratable"" for merit promotion."
"The supervisor must complete Form 6850-BU or Form 6850-NBU, as appropriate, indicating that each performance aspect is N/A."
"The supervisor will indicate that the reason for the appraisal is ""Other"" and show the reason as ""Merit Promotion."""
"The period covered should indicate the employee’s actual work period, if any, during the current appraisal year

Since a MPA cannot become a rating of record, no reviewing official signature is required and no overall rating is assigned

A copy of the ""Not Ratable"" Form 6850-BU or Form 6850-NBU must be shared with the employee

The supervisor should submit this Form 6850-BU or Form 6850-NBU to the servicing Employment Office to document in the merit promotion file that the employee is ""Not Ratable""

(7) Bargaining unit employees only:

Before the supervisor submits an annual appraisal to the ranking panel/official to be used in a competitive action, the employee must have received it for at least three workdays to allow for the employee’s comments."
"The supervisor must attach any employee comments to the appraisal

If a supervisor failed to issue a timely and current performance appraisal for the merit promotion package, the employee may submit their self-assessment."
"This self-assessment cannot propose a summary rating higher than the employee's current rating of record

6.430.2.5.3 (01-01-2007)
Ad Hoc Performance Appraisals for Bargaining Unit Seasonal Employees
(1) The performance ranking process for the release and recall of bargaining unit seasonal employees is based on the employee's most recent annual performance appraisal."
"(2) In the absence of an annual appraisal, the supervisor will prepare an ad hoc performance appraisal for those employee's meeting the minimum appraisal period requirements."
(3) These ad hoc appraisals are only used for the release and recall of bargaining unit seasonal employees and cannot be used for the annual rating of record.
"Note: For more information, see the National Agreement (Document 11678), Article 12."
"6.430.2.5.4 (10-28-2011)
Within-Grade Increase (WGI) Determination
(1) The OPM regulations require that the decision to grant or deny a WGI must be supported by the employee’s most recent rating of record."
"If the most recent rating of record does not support the decision, a new rating must be prepared."
"(2) Examples of when a new rating of record is required:

A WGI has previously been denied and the employee’s performance has improved to the ""Fully Successful"" level, making the employee eligible for a WGI

If the most recent rating of record is at least ""Fully Successful"" but the employee’s performance has now decreased below that level, the supervisor must prepare a new rating of record to support the denial of the WGI

(3) This rating of record prepared to support or deny the WGI becomes the employee’s new rating of record for all purposes."
"Note: For more information on WGI determinations for bargaining unit employees, see the National Agreement (Document 11678 ), Article 17."
"6.430.2.5.5 (10-28-2011)
Not Ratable Determinations
(1) A supervisor may be unable to rate an employee at the end of the performance appraisal period, in which case no rating of record shall be recorded for the employee for that performance appraisal period."
"(2) Examples of ""Not Ratable"" situations include:

The employee was on extended leave and did not have at least 60 days of performance during the appraisal period."
The employee was not eligible for extension of the appraisal period as specified in IRM 6.430.2.4.2.2.
"For non bargaining unit employees only - The employee is newly-hired and does not have 60 days remaining in their performance appraisal period

The employee served as a full time union representative and does not have 120 hours of IRS direct work

The employee was detailed to a position excluded from the performance appraisal requirements in 5 CFR Part 430, by law, or other OPM regulation

(3) If the supervisor determines that the employee is ""Not Ratable"" at the end of the employee’s designated performance appraisal period, the supervisor must complete a Form 6850-BU or Form 6850-NBU and indicate in the overall rating block that the employee is ""Not Ratable"" and specify the reason for that determination in the space provided."
"(4) The supervisor will enter the ""Not Ratable"" designation into the automated personnel system to indicate that the employee could not be rated and to ensure that the employee is not shown as missing a rating of record."
"(5) In those cases where an employee cannot be rated, the employee may be granted a ""Waiver of Requirement for Determination"" for a WGI as specified in 5 CFR Section 531.409(d)."
"6.430.2.5.6 (01-01-2007)
Retroactive Appraisals
(1) The OPM regulations and IRS policy prohibit retroactive ratings of record."
"The OPM regulations (5 CFR Section 430.208(h)(i)) do not permit the assignment of a rating of record for an earlier appraisal period, if a rating has been assigned for a subsequent period or if the agency-established deadline for providing a rating of record has passed

It is the Service's policy that supervisors can prepare a rating of record up to 364 days following the end of the employee's appraisal period, unless a rating of record for a later period has been completed."
"Once that 364 day period has passed, no rating of record can be assigned for the previous appraisal period

(2) Exceptions to the restrictions on retroactive appraisals include appraisals changed as a result of:

A grievance, complaint or other formal proceedings permitted by law or regulation

When the Service determines that a rating of record was incorrectly recorded or calculated

6.430.2.5.7 (06-12-2009)
Presumptive Ratings
(1) Presumptive ratings, for ratings of record, are prohibited by 5 CFR Section 430.208 (a)(2)."
(2) A rating of record can be based only on the evaluation of actual job performance for the designated performance appraisal period.
A supervisor must not issue a rating of record that assumes a level of performance by an employee without an actual evaluation of that employee’s performance.
"6.430.2.6 (06-12-2009)
Conducting the Performance Appraisal Meeting
(1) The performance appraisal is final when it is issued to the employee with the appropriate reviews and signatures."
"Thus, the appraisal should not be discussed with the employee until all appropriate reviews and signatures have been completed."
(2) The supervisor as the rating official conducts a performance appraisal meeting with the employee after the reviewing official approves the appraisal.
This meeting must be completed in accordance with the schedule shown in the National Agreement (Document 11678).
"(3) The supervisor should begin the performance appraisal meeting by reviewing the employee's self-assessment (if prepared), focusing on the areas of agreement between the self-assessment and the evaluator's assessment of the employee's performance."
The focus of this meeting should not only be on the past performance but also on future performance and areas for improvement during the upcoming appraisal period.
"While it is important to document accomplishments and past performance, documentation should focus on ""lessons learned"" for improving future performance."
"(4) During the performance appraisal meeting, the supervisor must share a copy of the completed performance appraisal form with the employee and discuss openly the ratings and rationale for those ratings."
"For areas of disagreement, the supervisor must determine if information might have been overlooked."
"(5) At the conclusion of the performance appraisal meeting, the supervisor may decide that it would be useful to discuss the expectations for the next appraisal cycle at this time by conducting the activities outlined in IRM 6.430.2.2, Step 1: Planning Expectations."
Often a separate meeting is required to plan future performance goals and should be scheduled as soon as practical.
"(6) When conducting the performance appraisal meeting, the supervisor should:

Acknowledge the full range of performance observed."
"For example, give appropriate balance to satisfactory work while also identifying areas that could be improved

Cite specific examples to demonstrate current performance, as well as examples of behavior/outcomes that occur at the next higher level of performance

Focus on the future by jointly developing a plan of action to improve performance

Follow a problem-solving approach."
"Discuss key areas for improvement by defining specific solutions to performance issues without assigning blame

Manage the emotions involved with evaluating performance."
"Allow employee to vent, listen carefully to the concerns, and provide constructive feedback."
"In some cases, it may be useful to postpone the remainder of the meeting so both participants can regroup

."
"6.430.2.7 (06-12-2009)
Processing the Signed Performance Appraisal
(1) Both the rating official and reviewing official must sign the performance appraisal for it to be used as the rating of record."
"The reviewing official has the final authority on whether to approve, modify or disapprove the overall rating."
(2) The employee is not required to sign the performance appraisal.
"If the employee chooses not to sign, the supervisor should document the employee's refusal."
The supervisor should inform the employee that refusal to acknowledge receipt of the appraisal does not make the rating of record invalid.
"(3) The original, completed performance appraisal form must be filed in the employee’s EPF along with any back-up documentation, and any accompanying narratives or self-assessments."
(4) The supervisor must follow the business unit’s procedures for ensuring that the employee’s annual appraisal is entered into the Service’s automated performance appraisal system.
"6.430.2.8 (10-28-2011)
Tracking Performance Appraisals
(1) The supervisor should review and take actions based on the information provided in ePerformance or on the information provided in the Pay Period Performance Management Listings Reports available on the HR Reporting Center website."
"(2) ePerformance reports provide information to the supervisor related to performance management responsibilities including:

Printable Performance Plans

Award Election Report

Status Summary Report

Missing Performance Documents

Performance Document Status

Documents Pending Rating Review

(3) The Pay Period Performance Management Listings Reports are available to each supervisor and each business unit via the HR Reporting Center website."
Supervisors may initiate an OL5081 for access as appropriate for their business unit.
"These reports provide information to the supervisor related to performance management responsibilities including:

Annual ratings due/overdue status

Employee due/overdue eligibility status for WGI

Last rating of record and rating dates input in the automated personnel system."
"6.430.2.9 (10-28-2011)
Rebuttals and Grievances
(1) Employees are encouraged to resolve matters of disagreement concerning the overall ratings with their rating official and reviewing official."
"(2) An employee who is dissatisfied with the overall rating may ask for reconsideration from the rating official in lieu of, or in addition to, adding comments to the performance appraisal."
(3) Bargaining unit employees must follow the process outlined in the National Agreement (Document 11678) for requesting a review of their performance appraisals.
They should consult their NTEU steward.
(4) Non bargaining unit employees should follow the IRS Agency Grievance System procedures specified in IRM 6.771.1 to request reconsideration of their performance appraisals.
(5) Non bargaining unit employees may also consult their servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office to discuss appeal procedures.
Bargaining unit employees should consult their NTEU steward.
(6) Any change to the overall rating must be reviewed against the CJE performance plan to ensure the appropriateness of the changed rating.
"6.430.2.10 (06-12-2009)
Amending a Rating
(1) A rating may be amended after it is given to the employee for the following reasons:

Reconsideration by the rating official resulting from an informal request by the employee within 60 days of issuance

Discovery of an error in recording or calculating the rating of record

Changes directed via a formal complaint procedure

(2) A change in the employee's performance after the end of the appraisal period is not a justification for amending a rating."
"(3) The following steps should be followed to amend a rating of record:

The supervisor selects Rework Rating from the document in ePerformance

The appraisal period remains the same as the original

All parties of the original rating should sign the amended rating (employee, rating official, and reviewing official)

The amended rating must not contain documentation in any section of the form that would indicate the evaluation is the result of a grievance or any similar action."
"This includes the performance notes section of the online document

The original copy of the amended form should be placed in the employee’s EPF

The previous rating will be destroyed and replaced with the corrected rating

6.430.2.11 (01-01-2007)
Step 4: Recognizing Performance
(1) The supervisor may recognize strong performance through informal acknowledgements and formal recognition."
"Note: See IRM 6.451.1 Employee Performance and Utilization - Awards and Recognition or the Awards and Recognition

"Exhibit 6.430.2-1
Examples of the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers Retention Standard Behavior
Standard: Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers

Consistent with the incumbent's official responsibilities, administers the tax laws fairly and equitably, protects all taxpayers' rights, and treats them ethically with honesty, integrity, and respect."
"EXAMPLES OF PERFORMANCE THAT MEETS THE STANDARD:

As observed in case file or Integrated Data Retrieval System actions, through management monitoring of phone calls, and through feedback received from the taxpayer and other outside sources, the employee:

Responds to taxpayers in a timely manner."
"Identifies self by providing name and badge number, as required by RRA ‘98 Section 3705."
Protects taxpayer rights to privacy by following disclosure procedures.
Identifies taxpayers whose circumstances and/or account history meet Taxpayer Advocate case criteria.
Uses communication techniques that are appropriate for the listener’s level of understanding.
Advises taxpayers and their representatives of appeal rights and actions necessary to pursue and protect their rights.
"Conducts oral and written communications with taxpayers that are professional, courteous, and accurately state the facts."
"Takes or recommends appropriate actions in a timely fashion which will resolve taxpayer filing and payment delinquencies, addressing all issues with the taxpayer to ensure the taxpayer remains compliant."
Listens to and considers the taxpayer’s point of view.
"Identifies when action is required by another function to resolve the taxpayer’s issue/inquiry, and ensures that the transfer of contact is made in a timely manner."
"Advises taxpayers of full personal impact, such as interest and penalty accumulation, when taxpayers advise they cannot pay their liability in full."
"EXAMPLES OF PERFORMANCE THAT FAILS TO MEET THE STANDARD:

Note: The IRS has determined that infrequent lapses that are inadvertent or unavoidable should not result in a ""Not Met"" rating on the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"Instead, they will result in a discussion between the supervisor and employee to reinforce the importance of the standard and explore ways to prevent a recurrence."
"As observed in case file or Integrated Data Retrieval System actions, through management monitoring of phone calls, and through feedback received from the taxpayer and other outside sources, the employee:

Discusses specific taxpayer information with others who do not have an official ""need-to-know."""
Fails to identify taxpayers whose circumstances and/or account history meet Taxpayer Advocate case criteria.
"Provides oral and/or written responses containing wording or tone which is discriminatory, discourteous, disrespectful, intimidating; which misstate the facts; or are inappropriate to the taxpayer’s level of understanding."
Takes improper actions that place taxpayer in a hardship condition.
Does not follow installment agreement procedures when responding to installment agreement requests from taxpayers and their representatives.
"Does not apply appeal rights, or advise taxpayers and their representatives of those rights."
"Does not take or recommend appropriate actions that will resolve taxpayer filing and payment delinquencies, or consistently takes/recommends those actions in an untimely fashion, or fails to address all issues with the taxpayer to ensure that the taxpayer remains compliant."
"Does not convey personal impact information to taxpayers, such as penalty and interest accumulation, when the taxpayer advises they cannot pay their liability in full."
Fails to consider all relevant information provided by the taxpayer.
"Exhibit 6.430.2-2
Guidelines For Developing Critical Job Element (CJE) Performance Plans
(1) Introduction:

(2) The process of performance evaluation guides employees to concentrate on mission related work by making a clear line of sight from their own tasks to the agency’s mission."
"Along the way, the line of sight takes in the short and long term objectives of the work unit and how they tie to agency objectives and the organizational balanced measures."
A core concept is that employees will use their initiative to work towards agency mission if they can see a clear path between their day-to-day tasks and the agency mission.
Every step of the evaluation process is directed at illustrating and supporting that line of sight.
"(3) Two Internal Revenue Service (IRS) programs support this line of sight:

Balanced Measures – tie organizational objectives and actions to the mission

Critical Job Elements (CJEs) – tie individual employee tasks and performance to organizational balance measures

(4) Employees are evaluated by the IRS Performance Management System that supports and aligns employee performance with the IRS mission and balanced measures."
"The IRS Balanced Measurement System is designed to measure organizational performance and focus individuals and the organization on achieving the Service’s overall mission and strategic business goals, rather than achieving a specific target or number."
"The IRS has identified three balanced measures to support its mission and strategic goals:

(5) 1."
"Employee Satisfaction – To create an enabling work environment for employees by providing quality leadership, adequate training and effective support services."
(6) 2.
Customer Satisfaction – To provide accurate and professional services to internal and external customers in a courteous and professional manner.
(7) 3. Business Results (Quality and Quantity) – To generate a productive quantity of work in a quality manner.
"(8) IRS Performance Management System:

(9) A supervisor's assessment of an employee’s performance against that employee's CJEs forms the basis for:

Recognizing and rewarding the employee

Determining employee development needs

Taking performance based actions, if necessary

(10) All new or revised CJE performance plans and aspects must align with the IRS balanced measures."
"All CJE performance plans, (including any new or revised CJE performance aspects) are controlled and approved by the Human Capital Office (HCO), Performance Management and Recognition office."
"(11) CJE performance plans, including CJEs and aspects, are used to evaluate individual employee performance at the IRS for employees who are not managers, management officials, or confidential management/program analysts."
"(12) CJEs:

(13) The CJEs are the critical actions, objectives and results that the IRS expects its employees to accomplish during an appraisal year."
All employees whose performance is evaluated against CJEs have the same five CJEs.
"These CJEs are defined as:

(14) Employee Satisfaction – Employee Contribution– Describes how the employee’s actions contribute to the overall office working conditions."
"The employee supports the workplace climate where ethical behavior is paramount and everyone is treated with honesty, dignity and respect, free from harassment and discrimination."
This CJE is common to all employees.
"This CJE supports the strategic goal of ""Productivity through a Quality Work Environment."""
(15) Customer Satisfaction – Knowledge – Describes how the employee promotes the satisfaction of taxpayers and customers by providing the technical expertise to serve the customers with professional and helpful service.
"Accurate identification and resolution of issues and the correct interpretation of laws, rules, regulations and other information sources are key components of this CJE."
(16) Customer Satisfaction – Application– Describes how the employee promotes the satisfaction of taxpayers and customers through professionally and courteously identifying customers’ needs and/or concerns and providing quality products and services.
Communication to the customer is appropriate for the issue and encourages voluntary compliance.
(17) Business Results – Quality – Describes how the employee promotes the achievement of business results by completing assignments thoroughly and accurately within established guidelines.
The use of proper research and analytical tools and the protection of taxpayer privacy are key components of this CJE.
(18) Business Results – Efficiency – Describes how the employee promotes achievement of business results by completing assignments timely within established guidelines.
The use of proper workload management and time utilization techniques is a key component of this CJE.
"(19) Performance Aspects

(20) Performance aspects are a portion of each CJE that describes the areas under which employees must perform in that CJE, vary with the type of CJE and occupation, and further define the CJEs meaning."
A performance aspect is a group of related tasks and performance standards that identify expectations for performance of those tasks.
The performance aspect clearly tells employees how they are to perform that portion of the CJE and is a key component of the IRS performance appraisal system for employees evaluated by CJEs.
"How well an employee performs in the individual aspects determines the employee’s rating on each CJE, which in turn determines the employee’s overall rating."
(21) Well-written and descriptive performance aspects are the basis of the performance management process.
CJEs describe what an employee must do; performance aspects provide more specificity on what must be done and describe how well the work must be done.
"(22) Guidelines for Developing Performance Plans:

(23) To streamline and simplify the IRS Performance Management System, the goal is to develop one performance plan for all grades in an occupation unless significant differences in duties warrant separate CJE performance aspects."
(24) Developing new or revised performance plans is a five-step process.
"These five steps are:

(25) Step 1: Prepare a list of significant tasks in statement form

(26) Step 2: Align the task statements with the appropriate CJEs

(27) Step 3: Identify performance aspects for each CJE and develop the job analysis

(28) Step 4: Develop individual aspect performance level descriptions

Meets

Exceeds

Fails

(29) Step 5: Develop the final CJE package

(30) Step 1: Prepare a List of Significant Tasks in Statement Form

(31) To ensure all significant tasks are covered by at least one of the CJEs, it is important to conduct a job analysis."
"Supervisors, along with subject matter experts (SMEs), identify major job requirements by highlighting them in the body of the standard position description (SPD) and describing in more detail separately if the description in the SPD is inadequate."
Each job may have hundreds of tasks.
Part of the first step is to generate a list of the tasks.
"After generating the task list, start the process of reducing them to the most significant ones."
"Factors to consider are:

Which duties or tasks are completed most often?"
How much time is spent performing the task?
Does the task carry out a statutory or regulatory requirement?
Is the task mentioned in the SPD?
Does the employee have control over the task?
How difficult is the task?
"If an error is made in performing the task, what are the consequences to the organization?"
Is the duty or task considered a collateral duty or other duty as assigned?
(32) PRODUCT: List of significant tasks of the job in statement form.
"(33) EXAMPLE:

Prepares written correspondence

Answers telephone calls

Processes mail

Reviews and routes correspondence

Maintains time and leave records."
(34) The number of task statements should reflect the complexity of the job.
There may be 20 or more significant task statements.
"(35) Step 2: Align Task Statements with the Appropriate CJEs

(36) All tasks should be grouped under the most appropriate CJE."
This aids in performance aspect development.
"Align all task statements with the most appropriate CJE

Group those task statements which stress the same or very similar tasks

(37) Use the CJE standardized definitions to determine the most appropriate placement of the task."
"(38) Important Note: Since the Employee Satisfaction - Employee Contribution CJE is the same for all positions and cannot be modified, do not align any tasks with this CJE."
"(39) Example of aligning task statements with appropriate CJE:

SIMILAR TASK STATEMENTS

APPROPRIATE CJE

Prepares written correspondence

Customer Satisfaction - Application

Answers telephone calls



Processes mail



Reviews and routes correspondence



Maintains time and leave records



(40) Important Note: While it is possible to associate task statements with more than one CJE, you must select the most appropriate CJE because task statements and performance aspects can align with only one CJE."
"(41) Step 3: Identify Performance Aspects and Develop Job Analysis

(42) Within each CJE, group similar tasks into a 2-3 word task statement."
This task statement becomes part of the performance aspect.
"(43) Performance aspects:

Must apply to performance-related activities not conduct

Must refer to objective, realistic and measurable tasks

Cannot include the use of records of tax enforcement results (ROTERs)

TASK STATEMENTS

2-3 WORD TASK STATEMENT

PERFORMANCE ASPECT

Process Mail

Prepares and processes correspondence

Correspondence

Reviews and routes correspondence





Prepares correspondence





(44) To the extent possible, you should develop at least three aspects per CJE:

An odd number of aspects is required for bargaining unit positions and desirable for non bargaining unit positions."
All aspects must be lettered and numbered.
The HCO has established a limit of five aspects for each CJE to make performance plans compatible with ongoing automation efforts.
"(45) Job Analysis (KSA Identification)

(46) The supervisor and SMEs should also list the Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs) that are required to perform the identified major job requirements and are important in evaluating candidates for merit promotion."
This job analysis should be linked to the new or modified CJE performance aspects.
"See Step 5, Develop the Final CJE Package, for more information about submitting the job analysis and KSAs to the HCO."
(47) A sample of a well-constructed and properly documented job analysis can be found on the Critical Job Elements (CJE) site at https://irssource.web.irs.gov/Lists/CareerOpportunities/DisplaySection.aspx?SectionName=4.
"(48) Step 4: Develop Individual Aspect Performance Level Descriptions

(49) The performance levels are a portion of the performance aspect that clearly tells the employee how the employee is to perform in that aspect."
Performance is measured against specific standards found in the performance levels that describe how well the behavior must be performed.
"Consistently demonstrated superior performance in any of the performance aspects will result in an ""Exceeds"" rating for that aspect."
"(50) Performance aspects tell employees how they are to perform in order to Meet, Exceed, or Fail in that performance aspect."
(51) CJE definitions and the tasks shown in each performance aspect describe what performance employees must demonstrate; performance levels in each aspect describe how well the performance is to be accomplished.
"(52) In accordance with IRS/NTEU contractual agreements, all performance aspects must be written at three levels—Exceeds, Meets, or Fails."
This policy also applies to non bargaining unit positions.
"(53) The three performance levels used to measure CJEs are:

Exceeds - the employee consistently demonstrates the performance."
Meets - the employee generally demonstrates the performance.
Fails - the employee more than occasionally fails to demonstrate the performance.
(54) Applying these levels to the evaluation process allows the rating official to evaluate an employee in a fair and efficient manner.
"(55) The above performance levels are described within three quality ranges:

Consistently - Almost always; the employee performs the task or aspect in a systematically uniform, reliable level of performance and rarely varies from that level."
Generally - As a rule; the employee usually performs the task or aspect at this level in a reasonably inclusive manner.
"Occasionally - Means performance in the range below ""generally."""
"Occasionally is defined as ""now and then; from time to time; infrequently; seldom."""
(56) These terms are used to differentiate work at the three performance levels.
(57) Important Note: Performance aspects should be developed at the Meets level first; Exceeds and Fails levels can be derived from the baseline performance level description for Meets.
"(58) Five factors should be considered when deciding how to write a performance aspect at the Meets level:

Is it observable?"
"- Can it be witnessed; is it concrete and definable

Is it measurable?"
"- Can it be assessed or evaluated; are different performance levels distinguishable

Is it achievable?"
"- Is it possible to accomplish; do no barriers exist

Is it reasonable?"
"- Does employee have the necessary skills, knowledge, and ability to complete the assignment; can it be accomplished within a specific time frame

Is it understandable?"
"- Is what is being measured clear; is when the performance will be measured clear; is how the performance will be measured clear

(59) Important Note: Avoid these when developing performance at the Meets level:

Absolute Standards - The Meets performance level cannot be written in absolute terms (for example, 100 % accuracy)."
"Meets performance levels written without the opportunity for errors are called absolute standards and are prohibited by OPM, the Merit System Protection Board, and the Federal courts unless a single failure to perform would result in loss of life, injury, breach of national security, or great monetary loss

Backward Standards - Do not describe work that does not get done instead of describing what the employee needs to accomplish."
"Ask yourself the following question when developing the Meets performance level: Does the performance level express the work that you expect to see for the employee to be successful or does it describe negative performance

(60) Product:

(61) Rewrite the 2-3 word task statements into more complete sentences to help define the action the employee performs and the expected results of the action."
Each task statement begins with an action verb that is as specific as possible.
"(62) Task statements include numbers or phrases that describe how well, how many, or how soon a task should be accomplished:

Be specific and avoid vague terminology such as ""be familiar with,"" ""deals with,"" and ""be responsible for""

The Meets level allows room for outstanding accomplishment (Exceeds)."
"The Meets level should not be written at such a high level that there is no room to define an Exceeds level

(63) Example:

(64) Generally prepares and processes (action verbs) correspondence within established timeframes to ensure prompt response to customers (expected result)."
(65) Performance aspects for the Exceeds and Fails levels are developed only after the performance aspects for the Meets level have been completed.
(66) Performance aspects measure how well the work is being performed.
"You may consider the following factors in defining levels of performance for Exceeds and Fails:

Quality - How well it is done

Quantity - Time utilization

Timeliness - Adherence to specified time frame

Manner - The way the work is done or style

Method - Procedures, policies, or technical requirements

Cost - Dollars and staff requirements

(67) The Exceeds and Fails levels should consider the following five factors:

The performance aspects should be reasonable and measurable

Each consecutive level of the aspect should assume achievement at the next lower level with a logical connection between levels

The Exceeds level should be beyond the performance of the majority of employees, but attainable by some

The Exceeds level should show meeting as well as going beyond the Meets level, often describing productivity improvement

Each item in the Meets level must be reflected in the Fails level

(68) EXAMPLE:

(69) Exceeds: Consistently prepares and processes correspondence within established timeframes to ensure prompt response to customers."
(70) Meets: Generally prepares and processes correspondence within established timeframes to ensure prompt response to customers.
"(71) Fails: More than occasionally fails to prepare and process correspondence within established timeframes, which does not ensure prompt response to customers."
"(72) Heightened Level of Performance

(73) Some performance aspects found in the CJEs require a heightened level of performance because of their sensitivity or importance to the IRS."
"These special aspects include such areas as statute determination, security, disclosure, privacy, and timekeeping for secretaries and related administrative positions."
"(74) Heightened levels of performance can be defined in the following terms:

Always - Without exception; describes the Exceeds level of performance only for those aspects requiring a heightened level of performance."
Except in very rare circumstances - Describes the Meets level of performance only for those aspects requiring a heightened level of performance.
"In determining the existence of ""very rare circumstances,"" the supervisor considers mitigating and aggravating factors that may include, but are not limited to, the complexity of the issue and the gravity of the occurrence."
Fails to…in the absence of very rare circumstances - Describes the Fails level when there is a heightened level of performance required at the Meets level.
"Any failure that does not result from ""very rare circumstances"" will result in a Fails rating."
"(75) The following describes the heightened performance levels:

Exceeds: The employee always demonstrates that behavior."
"Meets: The employee, except in very rare circumstances demonstrates the behavior."
Fails: The employee fails to demonstrate the behavior in the absence of very rare circumstances.
"(76) Step 5: Develop the Final CJE Package

(77) Performance aspects must be developed for each CJE at each level of performance and recorded in the template provided later in this exhibit."
(78) The Employee Satisfaction - Employee Contribution CJE will always remain the same for all positions.
"(79) While the CJEs and their definitions will always remain the same, the number, title, and content of the performance aspects will vary by performance plan."
"(80) Completed CJE Performance Plan Packages

(81) Divisions and functions must ensure that the above steps are followed when new performance plans are developed or existing performance plans are modified."
A template for use in developing new or modified performance plans is provided in this exhibit.
"(82) Since performance plans and CJE aspects are intended to be as cross-functional as possible, divisions and functions should coordinate development of a new or revised performance plan with other divisions or functions that may use that performance plan."
"(83) Documenting the Job Analysis

(84) Divisions and functions must perform a complete job analysis when creating or modifying performance plans."
"This job analysis includes the following documentation:

A copy of the applicable SPD(s)

Major job requirements (should be highlighted in the body of the SPD and described in more detail on a separate sheet if the description in the SPD is inadequate)

A list of KSAs that are required to perform the identified major job requirements and are important in evaluating candidates

An explanation of the linkage of the listed KSAs to the new or modified CJE performance aspects

A statement indicating that all of the CJE performance plans for the occupation were reviewed and a new performance plan is required for this position

The name, title, pay plan/series/grade, signature, and signature date for SMEs responsible for job analysis validity (two or more recommended)

The name, signature, and signature date of the reviewing human resources specialist

(85) Divisions and functions must submit new or revised performance plans to the HCO, Performance Management and Recognition office, for review and approval."
"(86) After approval, the HCO will submit the new or revised performance plans covering bargaining unit employees to the National Headquarters, NTEU, as required by the National Agreement Document 11678."
NTEU will be afforded an opportunity to bargain impact and implementation before the new or revised performance plans for bargaining unit employees are put into effect.
"(87) After performance plans are approved and NTEU is afforded an opportunity to comment on plans covering bargaining unit employees, the completed performance plans will be forwarded to the Multimedia Division for publication in its products catalog."

"(6) For paybanded managers, the date that the performance appraisal will be shared with the employee may be extended because of the Performance Review Board (PRB) appraisal review process."
This PRB review process will normally require additional time for the processing of paybanded performance appraisals and awards determinations.
It is the responsibility of the divisions and functions to specify their appraisal processing timeframes for paybanded positions.

6.430.3.1 (12-08-2017)
Program Scope and Objectives
This IRM provides policy and guidance on the Performance Management Program for Evaluating Managers, Management Officials, and Confidential Management/Program Analysts."
"Purpose: It provides the legal basis and manner in which the performance of managers, management officials, and confidential management/program analysts are evaluated."
"Audience: All supervisors, managers, management officials, human resources specialists, and labor relations specialists."
"Policy Owner: Associate Director, Performance Management Branch."
"Program Owner: Associate Director, Performance Management Branch."
Primary Stakeholders: Business Units Servicewide.
"6.430.3.2 (01-01-2007)
Overview and Coverage
This section describes the manner in which managers and management officials are evaluated."
"The requirements and procedures of this section also apply to employees whose positions are classified as management/program analysts, GS-343, and who are officially designated as confidential employees."
Note: A confidential employee is defined by 5 U.S.C.
"7103(a)(13), as ""an employee who acts in a confidential capacity with respect to an individual who formulates or effectuates management policies in the field of labor-management relations."""
"The performance of employees assigned supervisory codes 2 (supervisor or manager), 4 (supervisor-CSRA), 5 (management official), and in some instances supervisory code 7 (i.e., team leaders who lead management officials) are evaluated against critical performance expectations."
"In addition, certain non-bargaining unit management/program analysts, GS-343, who are officially classified as confidential and have supervisory codes 7 or 8 are also covered by critical performance expectations."
The supervisory code is found on the employees standard position description (SPD) and controls the appropriate performance plan.
"Supervisors should review IRM 6.430.1, Introduction to Performance Management, for background information before proceeding with this section."
It is the supervisor's responsibility to ensure that he or she administers the IRS Performance Management Program effectively and efficiently as it pertains to his or her employees.
"Additionally, supervisors must keep current on performance management policies and processes through training courses and on-line resources."
"For more information, see the performance management website http://hco.web.irs.gov/perfmgmt/index.html."
"6.430.3.3 (01-01-2007)
Step 1: Planning Critical Performance Expectations
During this step, the supervisor and the employee work closely together to plan and establish distinct commitments or objectives to be accomplished during the specified appraisal period and discuss how they relate to the responsibilities."
Effective planning of performance expectations helps ensure the alignment of individual performance with the business goals and objectives of the organization.
"6.430.3.3.1 (10-28-2011)
Starting the Performance Appraisal Cycle
Except in rare circumstances such as when the employee is on extended sick leave, the supervisor must meet with the employee within the first 30 days of the beginning of an employee's appraisal period, or when the employee is assigned to a new position for at least 60 days (e.g., temporary promotions, details), to review responsibilities and establish commitments or objectives and discuss the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"The performance appraisal cycle for managers, management officials, and confidential management/program analysts is based on the fiscal year and normally begins October 1."
"The supervisor reviews the employee's assigned SPD, verifying that it accurately reflects the assigned duties."
"If it does not, the supervisor contacts the Human Capital Office (HCO) for assistance in identifying the appropriate SPD or developing a new one."
"6.430.3.3.2 (06-12-2009)
Critical Performance Expectations
Managers, management officials, and confidential management/program analysts are rated against critical performance expectations."
"Critical performance expectations consist of three components:
Retention Standard for the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers."
Responsibilities.
Commitments or Objectives.
"6.430.3.3.2.1 (10-28-2011)
Retention Standard for the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, (RRA98) 1204, requires all IRS employees to be evaluated on the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
This requirement has been incorporated into a Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers that is the same for all employees.
"For more information on the requirements of the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers, see IRM 6.430.3.2.5 and IRM Exhibit 6.430.2-1, Performance Management Program for Evaluating BU & NBU Employees Assigned to CJEs."
"6.430.3.3.2.2 (01-01-2007)
Responsibilities
Responsibilities are common to all managers, management officials, and confidential management/program analysts, and are aligned with the IRS Balanced Measurement System."
Responsibilities guide the actions an employee commits to undertake during the performance appraisal period and describe how the employee performs his or her job.
"Responsibilities for managers are:
Leadership."
Employee Satisfaction.
Customer Satisfaction.
Business Results.
Equal Employment Opportunity.
"Responsibilities for management officials are:
Program Leadership."
Employee Satisfaction.
Customer Satisfaction.
Business Results.
Professional Expertise.
"Responsibilities for confidential management/program analysts are:
Analysis and Evaluation."
Employee Satisfaction.
Customer Satisfaction.
Business Results.
Communications.
"6.430.3.3.2.3 (01-01-2007)
Commitments
Commitments are derived from the Strategic Business Plans and establish a linkage between organizational performance and individual performance."
Commitments are specific for each employee.
Each commitment is a distinct action with identified and measurable results to be achieved during the performance appraisal period.
"6.430.3.3.2.4 (10-28-2011)
Objectives
Management/Program Analysts, GS-343, designated as non-bargaining unit because of the confidential exclusion have objectives in lieu of commitments."
"Objectives are a limited number of critical actions, goals, and/or results the confidential management/program analyst will be expected to accomplish during the appraisal year."
"These objectives should be derived from, and directly contribute to, the program priorities and goals established by the organizations annual business or operations plan."
Objectives are similar to commitments for managers and management officials and are a key component of these employees' critical performance expectations.
"6.430.3.3.3 (01-01-2007)
Reviewing Responsibilities
Both the supervisor and the employee should review the responsibilities found in Part I, Section A, of the appropriate performance agreement to ensure mutual understanding of how each responsibility applies to the employees expected performance during the upcoming performance appraisal period."
"6.430.3.3.4 (10-28-2011)
Establishing Commitments or Objectives
Commitments and objectives enable managers, management officials, and confidential management/program analysts to develop action items that will, in turn, carry out the Service's day-to-day operations, linking their activities to the IRS' goals and objectives."
"Each commitment or objective should relate to, and support, one or more of the responsibilities listed in the performance agreement."
The supervisor should share his or her commitments with the employee prior to the employee's commitments or objectives being developed.
The supervisor discusses how the employees commitments or objectives should link to the organizational workplans and balanced measures.
"Note: For additional information, see IRM 1.5.1, Managing Statistics in a Balanced Measurement System - The IRS Balanced Measurement System."
"The supervisor should review documents such as organizational program plans, business plans, site-specific issues/priorities, Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action plans, and balanced measures data when preparing to discuss with the employee what needs to be included in his or her commitments or objectives."
The supervisor and employee should identify the most important areas on which to focus.
"The supervisor and the employee jointly develop the employee's commitments or objectives, with the reviewing official having the final authority for approval of the performance agreement."
"6.430.3.3.4.1 (10-28-2011)
Guidelines for Developing Well Constructed Commitments or Objectives
Supervisors and employees should think of commitments and objectives as the ""What"" and responsibilities as the ""How."""
"Generally, a limited number of commitments or objectives should be established to represent challenges for the employee."
Each commitment or objective should be results oriented.
"When developing the commitments or objectives, discussions should include the means of accomplishing the commitments or objectives, such as: specific timing, expected performance levels, methods of measurement, and level of organizational support (funding, staff, and training) needed."
"The following should be considered when writing commitments or objectives:
State specifically what is to be accomplished, not general tasks, duties, or responsibilities of an ongoing job."
Describe challenging but realistic actions the employee can accomplish.
"Maintain a ""line of sight"" to the goals of the Service."
"Include a clear timeframe for accomplishment, some commitments or objectives may take less than one year to accomplish and others may take longer."
"If the timeframe is longer than one year, interim milestones should be identified in the performance agreement."
Verify they are achievable and can be monitored.
Focus on describing the outcomes or results that will exist when the commitment or objective has been successfully achieved.
Outline required organizational resources or support.
"Consider available resources from the employee's assigned organization, as well as other parts of the IRS."
"Keep in mind how the commitments or objectives will be measured, how the employee will demonstrate achievement."
For managers only: ensure the commitments or objectives are specific enough so that direct reports can understand them.
Focus on individual actions that support organizational priorities.
"Begin each commitment or objective with the phrase ""I will"" to frame what the employee will do rather than what the organization will achieve."
"When drafting commitments and objectives, use an explanatory conjunctive phrase such as ""so that"" , ""in order to"" or ""to ensure that"" to tie each commitment or objective to an expected result or outcome."
Consider what data sources will be used to monitor progress in meeting commitments or objectives.
"Note: For more information on writing commitments, see Writing Performance Commitments, A Reference Guide for Managers and Management Officials at http://hco.web.irs.gov/perfmgmt/perfplan/mgmtoffic/writecommitments.html and ELMS self-instructional Writing Commitments for Managers and Management Officials."
"6.430.3.3.4.2 (06-12-2009)
Documenting Commitments or Objectives
After the supervisor and the employee discuss and agree on commitments or objectives, they are recorded under Part I, Section B of the appropriate performance agreement form."
The supervisor and the reviewing official make the final determination whether the commitment or objective should be included in the performance agreement if the supervisor and the employee cannot agree on the commitments or objectives.
It is important to document any changes in the commitments or objectives throughout the performance appraisal period.
"6.430.3.3.4.3 (10-28-2011)
Getting Behind the Numbers
Commitments or objectives should be qualitative in nature, but can and should be guided by the organization's quantitative performance measures."
The reason for this restriction is fundamental to the intent of the balanced measurement approach and critical to changing behaviors.
"If individuals are held accountable solely for achieving specific numerical targets, the natural response is to focus attention on the numbers and not on the actions."
"""Getting behind the numbers"" is a seven-step problem-solving process, as shown in Figure 6.430.3-1."
"Throughout this process, numbers are only a starting point."
"The objective is to identify individual commitments, objectives, or actions to improve organizational performance."
"IRM 1.5.2, Managing Statistics in a Balanced Measurement System - Section 1204 Certification and Independent Review Processes, provides more detail on how to use numbers appropriately in evaluating organizational and individual performance and the prohibition in using Records of Tax Enforcement Results (ROTERs) in evaluating the performance of managers, management officials, and confidential management/program analysts."
"In evaluating the performance of a manager, management official, or confidential management/program analyst, the numerical results achieved with any of the IRS Balanced Measures (Employee Satisfaction, Customer Satisfaction, and Business Results) will never equate directly to a particular rating."
"Rather, an evaluation should focus on the actions that were taken (commitments or objectives) against the objectives and the results achieved to improve performance in each responsibility."
The numerical results are helpful only for making an initial assessment of the impact those actions had on the Responsibilities.
"Figure 6.430.3-1

This is an Image: 37673001.gif

Please click here for the text description of the image."
"6.430.3.3.4.4 (06-12-2009)
Use of Employee Survey Scores in Commitments
Although employee engagement issues related to Leadership, Employee Satisfaction, Business Results, and Equal Employment Opportunity are proper areas that should be considered in evaluating managerial performance, manager performance commitments should be written in terms of the actions the manager can take to influence the employee survey numerical score."
"Since the employee survey numerical scores do not reflect the specific actions the manager took to improve the issue affecting the workgroup performance, managerial performance commitments should not be written in terms of improving the quantitative score or the participation percentage."
The employee survey numerical score should only be considered an indicator pointing to areas which might need further consideration and may be used to determine the appropriate workgroup issues for development of managerial commitments.
"Commitments based on organizational performance objectives, such as the employee survey, should focus primarily on what actions the manager will take to improve the workgroup environment and bringing resolution to the issue where possible, since the survey scores may change for many reasons which are outside of the managers ability to control."
"6.430.3.3.5 (06-12-2009)
Discussing the Retention Standard for the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers
The supervisor must discuss with the employee behaviors that will allow the employee to meet the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers, circumstances that may result in a determination that the employee does not meet the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers, and the potential impact of not meeting the Retention Standard."
"IRM Exhibit 6.430.2-1, Performance Management Program for Evaluating BU & NBU Employees Assigned to CJEs provides examples of Retention Standard behavior that may result in a ""Met"" or ""Not Met"" rating."
"Discussions concerning the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers may include:
An explanation of the requirements of the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers in relationship to the employees job expectations."
The potential impacts of not meeting the standard.
"Avoidance of use of the words ""deliberately"" or ""intentionally"" in describing behavior that does not meet the standard."
"An explanation of why infrequent lapses that are inadvertent or unavoidable will not result in a ""Not Met"" rating."
"An explanation of why a ""Met"" or ""Not Applicable"" rating will have no effect on the summary evaluation rating, ranking in merit promotion actions, or entitlement to performance awards."
"An explanation of why a ""Not Met"" rating for the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers will result in a ""Not Met"" summary evaluation rating."
"A ""Not Met"" summary evaluation rating makes the employee ineligible for a performance award, within-grade increase (WIGI), career ladder promotion, competition for promotion, or satisfactory completion of a probationary period, and may result in the employees removal from the position and/or the IRS."
"A ""Not Met"" overall rating will also adversely affect an employees retention standing in a reduction in force (RIF)."
"Note: See IRM Exhibit 6.430.2-1, Performance Management Program for Evaluating BU & NBU Employees Assigned to CJEs and Retention Standard Guidance at http://hco.web.irs.gov/perfmgmt/evaluation/evalperf/nonmgrpolicy.html for additional information on the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"6.430.3.3.6 (12-08-2017)
National Security Critical Element
Executive Order 12958, Classified National Security Information, requires that all managers and management officials whose duties significantly involve the creation or handling of classified information and who handle national security information on a regular basis must have a critical element in their annual performance agreement dealing with this activity."
Holding a national security clearance does not automatically require that the National Security Critical Element be included in the performance plan.
"The critical element is only applicable for managers and management officials who have regular, hands-on-work that requires classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying national security information."
Each manager must determine on a case-by-case basis if their employees should be covered by this critical element.
"The U.S. Department of the Treasury Classified National Security Information Critical Element form should be added as a separate attachment to the performance agreements of affected managers, supervisors, and management officials."
"Because this element affects a limited number of employees, it has not been incorporated into Form 12450-A, Manager Performance Agreement, or Form 12450-B, Management Official Performance Agreement."
The element should be attached to the performance agreement as long as the employee continues to perform work that meets the requirements of the Executive Order.
"Upon deciding to incorporate the element into the performance agreement of a manager, supervisor, or management official, the manager must discuss the critical element with the employee and have the manager or management official acknowledge receipt via signature on the form."
"Information about the Classified National Security Information Critical Element, a Decision Table for Implementation of the National Security Information Critical Job Element (For Managers, Supervisors, and Management Officials), and a link to the Classified National Security Information Critical Element for Evaluating Managers, Supervisors, and Management Officials form can be found under the “Related Links” heading on the Managers Performance Plan page of the HCO Performance Management website at: http://hco.web.irs.gov/perfmgmt/perfplan/mgrperfplan/index.html."
"6.430.3.3.7 (12-08-2017)
Documenting the Performance Agreement
The rating official, reviewing official, and employee sign and date the performance agreement to acknowledge that they have discussed the critical performance expectations."
This discussion should occur within 30 days of the beginning of the appraisal period.
"The performance agreements for employees covered by the requirements of this section are:
Managers - Form 12450-A, Manager Performance Agreement."
"Management Officials - Form 12450-B, Management Official Performance Agreement."
"Confidential Management/Program Analysts (GS-343) - Form 12450-D, Management/Program Analyst Performance Agreement (Positions Designated as Confidential Only)."
"Following the discussion, the supervisor should give a copy of the performance agreement to the employee and file the original in the Employee Performance File (EPF)."
"For more information on the EPF, see IRM 6.430.3.3.3 and the Employee Performance File document at: https://portal.ds.irsnet.gov/sites/ERCDocs/2002/HCO/CompLvBr/EPFGuideforMgrs.pdf."
The employee and supervisor should use the performance agreement and the critical performance expectations to monitor accomplishments or other significant events as they occur.
"6.430.3.4 (01-01-2007)
Step 2: Monitoring Progress
During this step the supervisor should continuously monitor progress against critical performance expectations, identify accomplishments and deficiencies, and initiate corrective actions when necessary."
"6.430.3.4.1 (12-08-2017)
Monitoring Commitments or Objectives
After the supervisor and employee have reached agreement on a set of commitments or objectives, the supervisor should monitor the employee's progress in meeting the responsibilities and achieving the commitments or objectives throughout the appraisal period."
"At a minimum, the supervisor must conduct a mandatory mid-year progress review."
"This progress review generally occurs in April and should include a discussion of the employees progress in meeting expectations (Responsibilities, Commitments or Objectives, and Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers)."
"This mandatory mid-year progress review must be documented on the Manager, Management Official, or Confidential Management/Program Analyst Performance Agreement."
The supervisor should also document any other progress reviews held and provide a copy to the employee.
Documented observations throughout the performance appraisal period serve as an aid in completing the mandatory mid-year progress review and the annual evaluation.
"The supervisor should identify the actions taken to accomplish commitments or objectives, and responsibilities."
The supervisor should focus on the employees performance as it relates to the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers and progress toward achieving commitments or objectives.
"If necessary, the supervisor should identify improvement opportunities."
"At any point during the performance cycle, the supervisor and the employee can review and revise commitments or objectives to reflect changes in the priorities of the Service."
"Changes may be needed for reasons such as: the expectations of commitments or objectives changed; or the Service's mission, strategic business goals, or business plans changed; or the level of available support (e.g., staff, dollars, training) decreased or increased."
Changes to commitments or objectives must be made at least 60 days before the end of the performance appraisal period to avoid having to extend the appraisal period.
The supervisor may NOT use Records of Tax Enforcement Results (ROTERs) in monitoring progress against critical performance expectations.
The ROTERs do not convey whether an individual performed well under his or her critical performance expectations.
"For additional information on ROTERs, see IRM 1.5.2, Managing Statistics in a Balanced Measurement System - Section 1204, Certification and Independent Review Processes."
Progress reviews including mid-year reviews may not be disputed.
Assessments of performance at the time of a progress review may differ from the annual summary evaluation.
Disputes filed before the end of the appraisal period would be premature.
"However, employees may submit documentation to the supervisor regarding matters of concern on the progress review."
"The following includes actions the supervisor should take to monitor progress against critical performance expectations:
Record observations as they occur, recalling past behavior is often difficult."
"Focus on specific actions the employee took to accomplish commitments or objectives, and how responsibilities were demonstrated; avoid evaluating personality traits."
"Cite performance or results, not conduct or general impressions."
Document observations in sufficient detail to be understood by another supervisor.
Document performance for all employees consistently.
Avoid comparing one employee to another.
Maintain performance data in the employees EPF.
All documents used in formulating an evaluation must be shared with the employee prior to placing it in his or her EPF.
"Note: For additional information on EPFs, see IRM 6.430.3.3.3 and the Employee Performance File document at: https://portal.ds.irsnet.gov/sites/ERCDocs/2002/HCO/CompLvBr/EPFGuideforMgrs.pdf
."
"6.430.3.4.2 (10-28-2011)
Minimally Satisfactory and Not Met Performance
If at any time during the appraisal period an employee's performance in one or more critical performance expectations (Responsibilities, Commitments or Objectives, or the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers) falls below the ""Met"" level, the manager must provide assistance."
"The supervisor must consult with their servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office regarding any performance rating of ""Not Met"" or ""Minimally Satisfactory"" to ensure that all parties understand the implications of failing to improve."
"Employees who do not meet the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers, Commitments or Objectives and/or Responsibilities should be counseled as early as possible in the appraisal period."
"Failure to improve or to sustain a ""Met"" rating could impact an employee's ability to remain in his or her position."
"Failure to improve or to sustain a ""Met"" rating could also impact an employee's salary review and cause the employee to be ineligible for a pay increase under an IRS Payband System."
"Before a supervisor begins the formal process of taking a performance-based action, the supervisor needs to be aware that he or she has certain options."
"The law provides for two different processes for taking performance-based actions:
If a performance-based action is taken under 5 CFR Part 432, a formal opportunity to improve is required."
"If a performance-based action is taken under the adverse action procedures of 5 CFR Part 752, an opportunity period is not required."
"Note: Regardless of the process used, the supervisor must contact the servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office for assistance."
"""Not Met"" ratings must be reviewed and approved by an official higher than the rating official."
"When an employee's performance fails to meet established performance expectations at an acceptable level in one or more critical performance expectations (i.e., Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers, Commitments or Objectives and/or Responsibilities), the supervisor must notify the employee in writing."
"This notice must advise the employee of the following:
That his or her performance is unacceptable."
Which critical performance expectation(s) are not being performed in an acceptable manner.
"What is required to perform at the rating level of ""Met"" or above."
Any assistance that will be provided to the employee.
What the reasonable period to demonstrate acceptable performance will be.
"Failure to perform at an acceptable performance level may result in removal, reduction in grade, withholding of a WIGI, denial of a performance-based increase, or reassignment depending upon the performance factors."
Note: Supervisors must contact their servicing Labor Relations/ Employee Relations Office for assistance in dealing with an employees failure of a critical performance expectation.
"If the employee demonstrates acceptable performance during the opportunity period, the rating official retains the notice of unacceptable performance in the EPF for one year from the date the opportunity period became effective."
"In accordance with 5 U.S.C 4303(d) if, because of performance improvement by the employee during the notice period, the employee is not reduced in grade or removed, and the employee's performance continues to be acceptable for one year from the date of the advance written notice, any entry or other notation of the unacceptable performance for which the action was proposed must be removed from any record, manual and automated, relating to the employee."
The rating official is responsible for removing and destroying such records from the EPF and for initiating removal from the Service's automated personnel records.
"Saving Provision - Any administrative action initiated (e.g., an action taken against ""Not Met"" employees under 5 U.S.C 4303) must continue to be processed consistent with the procedures and requirements of the program in effect when the action was initiated."
"A rating of ""Minimally Satisfactory"" or ""Not Met"" will also lead to the employee's ineligibility to receive a within-grade increase, career ladder promotion, or to complete his or her probationary period."
"A rating of ""Minimally Satisfactory"" or ""Not Met"" will also lead to the employee's ineligibility to receive a basic pay increase under an IRS Payband System."
"Note: See IRM 6.531.1.2, Pay Under the General Schedule."
"6.430.3.4.3 (12-08-2017)
Employee Performance File (EPF)
The EPF consists of all performance ratings and other performance-related records maintained on an IRS employee in accordance with 5 CFR 293, Subpart D.
Note: For additional information, see the Employee Performance File document at: Employee Performance File document at: https://portal.ds.irsnet.gov/sites/ERCDocs/2002/HCO/CompLvBr/EPFGuideforMgrs.pdf
."
Management is responsible for creating records concerning employee performance and maintaining them in accordance with the Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act regulations.
"At a minimum, the EPF should contain forms and documents which:
Record and support the performance appraisal and individual performance plans."
Are used by the supervisor to recommend a personnel action affecting an employee when the basis for the action is performance related.
Are furnished in support of recommended actions and the agency's final decision on the matter.
"Note: Other types of documents and forms may include Individual Development Plans (IDPs), recommendations for training that are performance-related, and copies of supervisory counseling session records resulting in performance-based personnel actions."
"The following documents must be maintained for four years:
The Performance Agreement (Forms 12450-A,12450-B, or 12450-D appropriate for the employee's position)."
Progress review(s) documentation.
Employee self-assessments.
"Documented workload reviews, case file reviews, and job visitations."
Any other documentation that supports the performance rating.
"The supervisor must keep performance records in the EPF as long as necessary, if needed in connection with a grievance, appeal or judicial proceeding."
"For employees who are permanently changing positions within the IRS, the supervisor will ensure the employee's entire EPF is forwarded to the gaining supervisor."
"For employees who are accepting outside employment and leaving the IRS, who are accepting employment with another government agency, or who are resigning or retiring from the IRS, the supervisor must remove all of the ratings of record completed within the last four years from the separating employees EPF, attach these ratings of record to Transmittal Form 3210, and forward the package to the following address:
Internal Revenue Service - OPF Consolidation Site
440 Space Center Drive
Lee's Summit, MO 64064

The National Archives and Records Administration staff will ensure the ratings of record are filed in the Official Personnel Folder (OPF) before being sent to the Federal Records Center if the employee resigns or to the gaining agency if the employee transfers."
"Supervisors must destroy any remaining performance related documents unless such records are needed in connection with a grievance, appeal, or judicial proceeding."
"6.430.3.5 (06-12-2009)
Step 3: Evaluating Performance
During this step the supervisor completes the employee's performance appraisal and conducts a performance appraisal meeting with the employee."
"6.430.3.5.1 (06-12-2009)
The Annual Performance Appraisal Process
All employees who have served the minimum appraisal period of 60 calendar days are entitled to an annual performance appraisal that becomes the rating of record."
"Permanent supervisors, complete the annual performance appraisals for employees under their authority."
"Employees who are temporarily promoted or detailed to a supervisory position have the authority to complete the annual performance appraisals for employees under their supervision, as long as the employees meet the requirements for an annual performance appraisal."
There is no minimum period of time required for this authority.
"The employees performance must have been observed a minimum of 60 days in the appraisal period by any supervisor who was responsible for assigning, reviewing, and evaluating the employee's work."
"However, it is not necessary for the employee's current supervisor to have observed the employees performance under a signed performance plan for 60 days or more."
"The supervisor should consider the following when evaluating performance to complete an annual appraisal:
Position description."
Performance Agreement.
Documents in the employees EPF.
Mid-year and other progress reviews.
"Employee's written documents (management briefings, memos) and/or presentations given
Employee's self-assessment."
"Feedback from coworkers, taxpayers, and other customers."
Team assignments and contributions to the work group.
Special achievements.
"Note: For more information on the various reasons for performance appraisals, see IRM 6.430.2, Exhibit 6.430.2-3."
"6.430.3.5.1.1 (10-28-2011)
Appraisal Period
Employees covered by performance agreements are evaluated in accordance with appraisal periods based on the fiscal year."
"In general, the annual rating of record covers the full fiscal year regardless of permanent promotions, temporary promotions, details, projects, or task forces."
"If the employee has not been observed for 60 days on his or her performance plan at the time the employee's annual rating is due, the supervisor must:
Ensure that a performance agreement has been issued."
Ensure that the employee has signed the performance agreement.
Postpone any rating until the employees performance has been observed for a minimum of 60 days.
Use the employees existing rating of record as the current rating of record until the new performance appraisal is prepared.
"If the employee has no performance during the fiscal year on a signed performance agreement and the fiscal year has ended, the employee is considered ""Not Ratable"" for that fiscal year."
"See IRM 6.430.3.5.4 for more information on ""Not Ratable"" determinations."
"A new performance agreement is not required for an employee returning to his or her permanent position following a temporary personnel action, if the employee is returning during the same appraisal year."
"In this case, the supervisor for the employee's permanent position may reinstate the performance agreement previously in effect, rather than completing a new performance agreement."
The time previously accrued under that performance agreement would count toward the 60 day period for rating eligibility.
"6.430.3.5.1.2 (10-28-2011)
Performance Appraisal Due Dates
The supervisor must complete the employee annual appraisal within the scheduled time limits shown in Exhibit 6.430.2-4, provided the employee has been observed for 60 days or more against his or her signed performance plan during the appraisal period."
Departure appraisals are required for temporary assignments of 60 days or more during the appraisal period.
These appraisals should be completed within 30 days after the employee completes the temporary assignment and should be forwarded to the supervisor responsible for assigning the rating of record.
"Note: For more information concerning departure appraisals, see the discussion on departure appraisals in IRM 6.430.3.5.1, IRM 6.430.5, and Exhibit 6.430.2-3."
"6.430.3.5.1.3 (10-28-2011)
Extension of the Appraisal Period
When an annual rating of record cannot be prepared at the specified time, the appraisal period shall be extended for the minimum period to meet the conditions necessary to complete a rating of record."
"To extend the appraisal period, the employee must be in work status on the appraisal period ending date and have observed performance under a signed performance agreement during the fiscal year."
The supervisor must decide to extend the employee's appraisal period on or before the employee's appraisal period ending date.
"If the employee has no performance under a signed performance agreement during the fiscal year and the appraisal period has ended, the employee is ""Not Ratable"" ."
"See IRM 6.430.3.5.4 for more information on ""Not Ratable"" determinations."
The rating of record shall be prepared in accordance with the instructions in this section.
"Examples of extension situations include, but are not limited :
To meet the 60 day minimum performance appraisal period."
"However, the supervisor should not extend the appraisal period of a newly-hired employee solely to provide the employee with a rating of record."
"In that event, the employee is ""Not Ratable"" for the appraisal period."
"Note: For more information on ""Not Ratable"" determinations, see IRM 6.430.3.5.4."
To provide a new supervisor an opportunity to observe an employee's performance against current requirements when information concerning the employee's past performance is not available.
"To appraise an employee whose overall performance has been less than acceptable due to personal circumstances (e.g., extended illness or other circumstances), and there is evidence of improvement in the employee's performance."
To provide an employee who has been notified of his or her failure to meet one or more of the critical performance expectations an opportunity to improve performance.
"An extension of the appraisal period will not affect the next appraisal ""period covered"" ending date; however, it shortens the next ""period covered"" (specifically, the ""from"" date) by the length of the extension."
"When the appraisal period is extended, the supervisor shall immediately inform the employee and the reviewing official."
Supervisors should enter the employee's annual appraisal into the Service's automated performance appraisal system after the extended appraisal period is completed and the rating of record is assigned.
"6.430.3.5.1.4 (10-28-2011)
Dates on the Performance Appraisal Form
The supervisor should accurately annotate the appraisal period on the appraisal form."
"The date the annual appraisal period ends will normally be the ""to"" date under period covered on the performance agreement form."
The entire appraisal period including any extensions necessary should be indicated under the period covered.
"If an employee's departure from a permanent position is within 60 days from the date the appraisal period ends, the ""to"" date should reflect the actual departure date since that date reflects the date the employee actually departed his or her position."
"6.430.3.5.2 (10-28-2011)
Requesting the Self-Assessment
Self-assessments are narrative descriptions or lists of accomplishments that the employee develops to describe his or her realization of goals, objectives, achievements, and significant accomplishments or shortfalls during a specified appraisal period."
"An effective self-assessment describes the specific actions taken by the employee to accomplish work requirements identified by responsibilities, commitments or objectives, and the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers."
"As the end of the performance appraisal period approaches, the supervisor should request that the employee prepare a written summary of his or her performance not to exceed two pages."
"The supervisor should explain that the self-assessment becomes a part of the manager's, management official's, or confidential management/program analyst's performance agreement."
Providing a self-assessment contributes to the preparation of an accurate summary evaluation.
"6.430.3.5.2.1 (06-12-2009)
Preparing the Self-Assessment
In preparing the self-assessment, the employee should:
Review the duties and responsibilities of the position and the Responsibilities and Commitments/Objectives identified in the performance agreement for the performance period."
"Identify all significant results achieved that were reflected in the agreement especially those that contribute to the overall success of the IRS mission, strategic business goals, and business plans."
"Identify all significant results achieved that were not reflected in the agreement such as contributions to the workgroup, special achievements, and team assignments."
Review responsibilities required for success in the position and identify areas in which he/she excels or needs improvement.
The self-assessment should be based on self-analysis.
Recognition of performance by customers and peers may be included as well.
"Note: For more information on writing self-assessments, see Writing Self-Assessments Managers and Management Officials at http://hco.web.irs.gov/pdf/writingselfassmnts.pdf ."
"6.430.3.5.2.2 (10-28-2011)
Using Records of Tax Enforcement Results (ROTERs) in Self-Assessments
Although using ROTERs in self-assessments does not violate the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, (RRA98) 1204 or the implementing regulations, to dispel even the appearance of impropriety, employees should not be permitted to use ROTERs in self-assessments."
It is a violation if a ranking official or panel uses ROTER information in the ranking process or if a supervisor uses the information when evaluating employees' performance.
"If a manager, management official, or confidential management/program analyst submits a self-assessment with ROTERs, it should be returned to the employee for removal of the ROTERs."
"Note: For additional information on ROTERs, see IRM 1.5.2, Managing Statistics in a Balanced Measurement System - Section 1204 Certification and Independent Review Processes."
"6.430.3.5.3 (10-28-2011)
Completing the Summary Narrative
This narrative is limited to the space on the form and should outline the key accomplishments for each commitment or objective and relate accomplishments to performance in the responsibilities."
The supervisor should also consider all the performance agreements completed during the appraisal period for temporary assignments.
Do not include ROTERs in the Summary Narrative; ROTERs are not an indication of whether the employee performed well against the critical performance expectations.
"Note: For additional information on ROTERs, see IRM 1.5.2, Managing Section 1204 Statistics in a Balanced Measurement System, Uses of Statistics."
"In completing the Summary Narrative:
Be concise, but descriptive enough to give the next level reviewer an accurate picture of the strengths, development needs, and overall effectiveness of the employee."
Focus on what is important for that particular job and the performance agreement.
"Be clear about whether the employee exceeds, meets, or does not meet the Commitments or Objectives and Responsibilities."
Ensure that the Summary Narrative is consistent with the focus of the commitments or objectives and responsibilities outlined in the performance agreement.
"While the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers is not normally addressed in the Summary Narrative, it must be discussed if the rating for the Retention Standard is ""Not Met."""
"6.430.3.5.4 (10-28-2011)
Rating Critical Performance Expectations
The supervisor must use the rating definitions found in this section."
"6.430.3.5.4.1 (01-01-2007)
Rating Responsibilities
The supervisor assigns one of the rating levels to all of the responsibilities based on the definitions provided below:
Exceeded: In addition to placing appropriate emphasis on the five sets of responsibilities, served as a role model in one or more of the five sets."
Actions taken were exemplary in promoting accomplishment of the annual business plan and strategic goals.
Met: Placed appropriate emphasis on each of the five sets of responsibilities.
Appropriate actions were taken to support accomplishment of the annual business plan and strategic goals.
Not Met: Placed insufficient emphasis on one or more sets of responsibilities.
"Actions taken were inappropriate, ineffective, or undermined strategic goals or annual business plan accomplishment."
"6.430.3.5.4.2 (01-01-2007)
Rating Commitments or Objectives
The supervisor assigns one of the following rating levels to all of the Commitments or Objectives based on the definitions provided below:
Exceeded: Overcame significant obstacles, such as insufficient resources, conflicting demands, or unusually short time frames, in achieving or exceeding desired results."
Met: Achieved or made substantial progress toward achievement of desired results.
Not Met: Did not achieve or make substantial progress toward achievement of desired results.
"6.430.3.5.4.3 (06-12-2009)
Rating Performance Against the Retention Standard For the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers
The supervisor will determine whether the employee has performed duties with potential impact on taxpayer issues or outcomes during the appraisal period."
"If the employee has performed such duties, the supervisor will determine whether the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers has been met."
"If a rating of ""Not Met"" is determined, the supervisor must contact the servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office for guidance."
"Failure of the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers will result in a summary evaluation of ""Not Met."""
"If the employee has not performed duties with potential impact on taxpayer issues or outcomes during the appraisal period, the supervisor should check the ""Not Applicable"" block on the performance agreement."
"6.430.3.5.4.4 (01-01-2007)
Rating Performance Against the National Security Critical Element
The supervisor will consider whether the employee has performed duties concerning the handling of national security information on a regular basis during the appraisal period for all employees who are assigned this element."
"If the employee has performed such duties, the supervisor will determine whether the critical element has been met."
"If a rating of ""Not Met"" is determined, the supervisor must contact the servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office for guidance."
"Failure of the National Security critical element will result in a summary evaluation of ""Not Met."""
"If the employee has not handled classified national security information during the appraisal period, the supervisor should check the ""Not applicable"" block on the Classified National Security Information Critical Element form."
"6.430.3.5.5 (10-28-2011)
Assigning the Summary Evaluation Rating
The summary evaluation provides one rating for the combined performance against the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers, the Responsibilities, and the Commitments or Objectives."
The supervisor must also consider the rating for the National Security Critical Element for those managers or management officials who are covered by that element.
Failure of the National Security Critical Element is treated in the same manner as the failure of the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers.
"The summary evaluation balances the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers, Responsibilities, and Commitments or Objectives for the final rating and ties the Commitments or Objectives directly to the five Responsibilities and should ensure balance among all of the Responsibilities."
"The supervisor should only assign the annual summary evaluation at the end of the appraisal period for an employee who is on a permanent assignment or who is on a temporary promotion or detail at the end of the employees appraisal period and meets the conditions specified in IRM 6.430.5.3, IRM 6.430.5.4, and IRM 6.430.5.5."
"Note: See IRM 6.430.5, Performance Appraisals for Temporary Assignments, for more information about performance appraisals for temporary assignments."
"Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations prohibit setting quotas for summary evaluation ratings (i.e., a forced distribution of summary levels)."
Supervisors can complete a rating up to 364 days following the end of the appraisal period.
Lengthy delays should be extremely rare due to the potentially negative impact on both the individual and the organization.
The approving official has final authority to approve the summary rating.
It is not necessary for the supervisor to have observed the employees performance under a signed performance agreement for 60 days or more.
"However, the employees performance must have been observed by at least one other supervisor under a signed agreement for a minimum of 60 days within the appraisal period."
"In rare cases, it may be necessary to extend the appraisal period until the minimum 60 days has been met."
Note: See IRM 6.430.3.4.1.3 for more information on extending the appraisal period.
"If the employee has insufficient performance during the appraisal period to be assigned a rating of record, the employee will be designated ""Not Ratable"" for that period."
"Note: For additional information on ""Not Ratable"" determinations, see IRM 6.430.3.5.4."
"6.430.3.5.5.1 (10-28-2011)
Definitions for Summary Evaluations
The supervisor assigns the summary evaluation rating level based on the employees performance in his or her Responsibilities, Commitments, or Objectives and the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers using the definitions provided below:
Outstanding - The incumbent met the Retention Standard and performed as a model of excellence by exceeding responsibilities and commitments (or objectives) in his or her Agreement, despite constantly changing priorities, insufficient or unanticipated resource shortages, and externally driven deadlines."
He or she consistently demonstrated the highest level of integrity and performance in promoting the annual business plans and the Service's strategic goals and objectives.
His or her contributions had impact beyond his or her purview.
Exceeded - The incumbent met the Retention Standard and generally exceeded both the responsibilities and commitments (or objectives) in his/her Agreement.
"However, he or she may have met the Retention Standard and demonstrated exceptional performance in either responsibilities or commitments (or objectives) and met the expectations of the other."
"He or she may have overcome significant organizational challenges such as coordination with external stakeholders (National Treasury Employees Union, Congress, etc.)"
or insufficient resources.
His or her effectiveness and contributions may have had impact beyond his or her purview.
"Met - The incumbent met the Retention Standard and the responsibilities and commitments (or objectives) in his or her Agreement with solid, dependable performance."
Incumbent consistently demonstrates the ability to meet the requirements of the job.
Challenges encountered and resolved are part of the day to day operation and are generally routine in nature.
"Minimally Satisfactory - The incumbent met the Retention Standard and all responsibilities and commitments (or objectives), however, overall performance contains deficiencies which warrant improvement."
"Not Met - The incumbent failed to meet the Retention Standard, responsibilities, and/or commitments (or objectives)."
"Repeated observations of performance indicated negative consequences in key outcomes (e.g., quality, timeliness, business results, morale, etc.)."
Immediate improvement is essential.
"6.430.3.5.6 (06-12-2009)
Probation on Initial Appointment to a Competitive Position
A new employee begins his or her regularly scheduled annual appraisal period upon entrance on duty."
This may be at any point in the period of October 1 through September 30.
A supervisor should begin monitoring a new employee immediately to determine if the employee is willing and able to perform the work and is otherwise suited for retention in the position.
"Although formal performance improvement plans are not required for employees who are serving probationary periods, a supervisor should provide an employee who is not meeting his or her Responsibilities and Commitments or Objectives with enough information to help the employee understand how he or she is failing and how the employee might improve."
"Upon determination that a probationary employee either will not or cannot meet expectations, the supervisor must begin action to terminate the employee from his or her position and/or from Federal service."
"A rating of ""Met"" or higher rendered early during a probationary or trial period does not preclude a subsequent decision that the employee is not performing at expected levels or otherwise suitable to be retained."
"However, a supervisor should be able to provide specific examples either:
How performance and/or conduct deteriorated after the rating was assigned, or
How the conduct used to support the termination was unrelated to the performance appraisal."
"Supervisors should consult with the servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office regarding any performance rating of ""Not Met"" to ensure that all parties understand the implications of failing to improve."
"6.430.3.5.7 (01-01-2007)
Probation on Initial Appointment to a Supervisory/Managerial Position
Employees serving probationary periods for initial appointments to supervisory/managerial positions who do not meet expectations set forth in performance plans that relate to supervisory/managerial responsibilities will be returned to non-supervisory positions."
That decision can be made at any time during the one year probationary period.
"Although formal notice and opportunity to improve are not required, supervisors generally should provide at least enough information so that the new supervisor understands specific deficiencies in time to make corrections."
"A rating of ""Met"" or higher rendered early during the supervisory/managerial probationary period does not preclude a subsequent decision that the individual is not successfully performing the supervisory/managerial aspects of his or her position."
"However, a supervisor should be able to provide specific examples of deficiencies that occurred after the rating was rendered."
Decisions to remove probationary employees may be made at any time during the probationary period.
"Supervisors should consult with the servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office regarding any performance rating of ""Not Met"" to ensure that all parties understand the implications of failing to improve."
"6.430.3.6 (10-28-2011)
Additional Reasons for Performance Appraisals
The employee's annual appraisal is the most commonly given performance appraisal and becomes the employee's rating of record."
"Other performance appraisals, however, may be issued for specialized circumstances."
Some of these appraisals may also be used as the employee's rating of record.
"Note: For more information on the various reasons for performance appraisals, see Exhibit 6.430.2-3, and for more information about performance appraisal requirements for temporary assignments, see IRM 6.430.5."
"6.430.3.6.1 (10-28-2011)
Departure Appraisals
A departure appraisal is a performance appraisal prepared when either the supervisor or employee moves from a permanent or temporary assignment to another permanent or temporary assignment."
The employee must have been provided a performance agreement and served in the position for a minimum of 60 days to receive a departure appraisal.
"Each critical performance expectation is given a rating; however, a summary evaluation is not assigned unless the employee or supervisor departs his or her position within the last 60 days of the appraisal period and the appraisal becomes the rating of record."
"Types of departure appraisals:
Supervisor Departure: If a supervisor departs his or her position, a departure appraisal must be prepared for the employees under the supervisor's work unit."
"If the employee being rated is a manager or management official, the departure appraisal will become the employee's rating of record if the supervisor's departure occurs within the last 60 days of the employee's appraisal period."
"Employee Departure: If an employee departs his or her position, the supervisor must prepare a departure appraisal for that employee."
The employee's departure appraisal will become his or her rating of record if the departure occurs within the last 60 days of the employee's appraisal period.
"If not within the last 60 days, the employee's new supervisor will consider the departure appraisal when preparing the employee's rating of record."
"If a supervisor is assigned to a new organization and the employee accompanies the supervisor to the new organization and will occupy the same position, a departure appraisal is not required."
The supervisor must sign the departure appraisal and provide a copy to the employee for the employee's signature.
The approving official's signature is not required unless the departure appraisal will become the employee's rating of record.
"All departure appraisals must either be sent to the employee's new office (with the employee's EPF), if the employee is changing positions, or placed in the employee's EPF when the supervisor changes positions."
The rating official should consider all departure appraisals as input for preparation of the employees annual rating of record.
Departure appraisals are not required for employees leaving the IRS and not going to other Federal employment.
"For example, departure appraisals are not required for employees who resign or retire."
"6.430.3.6.2 (10-28-2011)
Appraisals for Merit Promotion
The employee's most recent rating of record will be used for merit promotion in nearly all cases."
A supervisor may prepare a new performance appraisal for merit promotion purposes only when the employee is newly hired or has returned to duty after a lengthy absence and has no rating of record on file.
"To be provided a merit promotion appraisal after a lengthy absence, the employee must not have had at least 60 days of performance under a signed performance agreement for the most recently completed appraisal period."
The newly hired employee must have been on board for at least 90 days after an initial appointment.
"In either instance, the employee must meet the minimum appraisal period requirements for the current appraisal period."
These merit promotion appraisals cannot be used as the employee's rating of record and are valid only for the specific merit promotion action.
"Since a merit promotion appraisal cannot become a rating of record, no approving official signature is required and no summary evaluation is assigned."
"Managers, management officials, and confidential management and program analysts who apply for bargaining unit positions must have their most recently completed performance appraisal converted to the performance appraisal form used for bargaining unit employees."
"Exhibit 6.335.1-4 of IRM 6.335, Promotion and Internal Placement, contains guidance on how that is accomplished."
"For a ""Not Ratable"" employee who has served 90 days on a competitive appointment but not served 60 cumulative days under a signed performance agreement, the supervisor must submit a statement to the servicing Employment Office indicating that the employee is ""Not Ratable."""
"These ""Not Ratable"" employees cannot receive any type of performance appraisal for merit promotion, even a ""presumptive"" Fully Successful appraisal."
"Employment Offices will not accept ""presumptive"" Fully Successful appraisals for merit promotion."
"6.430.3.6.3 (10-28-2011)
Within-Grade Increase (WIGI) Determination
The OPM regulations require that the decision to grant or deny a WIGI must be supported by the employee's most recent rating of record."
"If the most recent rating of record does not support the decision, a new rating must be prepared."
"A new rating of record is required when:
A WIGI was previously denied and the employee's performance has improved to the ""Fully Successful"" level making the employee eligible for a WIGI."
"The employee's most recent rating of record is at least ""Met"" but the employee's performance has now decreased below that level which would make the employee no longer eligible for the WIGI."
This rating of record prepared to support or deny the WIGI becomes the employee's new rating of record for all purposes.
"6.430.3.6.4 (10-28-2011)
Not Ratable Determinations
A supervisor may be unable to rate an employee at the end of the performance appraisal period, in which case no rating of record shall be recorded for the employee for that appraisal period."
"Examples of ""Not Ratable"" situations :
The employee was not assigned an approved performance plan for his or her position for at least 60 days during the appraisal period;
The employee is newly-hired and does not have 60 days remaining in his or her performance appraisal period;
The employee was on extended leave and did not have at least 60 days of performance during the appraisal period;
The employee was detailed to a position excluded from the performance appraisal requirements in 5 CFR Part 430, by law, or other OPM regulation."
"If the supervisor determines that the employee is ""Not Ratable"" at the end of the employees designated performance appraisal period, the supervisor must complete the performance agreement in the automated performance appraisal system and indicate that the employee is ""Not Ratable"" and specify the reason for that determination in the space provided."
"In those cases where an non paybanded employee cannot be rated, the employee may be granted a ""Waiver of Requirement for Determination"" for a WIGI as specified in 5 CFR 531.409(d)."
"6.430.3.6.5 (06-12-2009)
Retroactive Appraisals
The OPM regulations and IRS policy prohibit retroactive ratings of record."
"The OPM regulations (5 CFR 430.208(i)) do not permit the assignment of a rating of record for an earlier appraisal period, if a rating was assigned for a subsequent period or if the agency's established deadline for providing a rating of record has passed."
"It is the Service's policy that supervisors can effect a rating of record up to 364 days following the end of the employee's appraisal period, unless a rating of record for a later period has been completed."
"Once that 364 day period has passed, no rating of record can be assigned for the previous appraisal period."
"Exceptions include appraisals changed as a result of:
A grievance, complaint, or other formal proceedings permitted by law or regulation."
When the Service determines that a rating of record was incorrectly recorded or calculated.
"6.430.3.6.6 (01-01-2007)
Presumptive Ratings
Presumptive ratings for ratings of record are prohibited by 5 CFR 430.208 (a)(2)."
A rating of record can be based only on the evaluation of actual job performance for the designated performance appraisal period.
A supervisor must not issue a rating of record that assumes a level of performance by an employee without an actual evaluation of that employee's performance.
"6.430.3.7 (01-01-2007)
Conducting the Performance Appraisal Meeting
The performance appraisal is final when it is issued to the employee with all appropriate reviews and signatures."
"Thus, the appraisal should not be discussed with the employee until all appropriate reviews and signatures have been completed."
"For positions covered by Performance Review Boards (PRB), the performance appraisal is not considered final until the PRB has completed its process."
"The supervisor should begin the performance appraisal meeting by reviewing the employee's self-assessment, focusing on the areas of agreement between the self-assessment and the supervisor's assessment of the employee's performance."
"During the performance appraisal meeting, the supervisor should share a copy of the completed performance agreement with the employee and discuss openly the ratings and rationale for those ratings, with an eye towards reaching consensus."
"For areas of disagreement, the supervisor should determine if any information was overlooked."
"The supervisor should consider the following when conducting an appraisal meeting:
Always acknowledge the areas of outstanding performance, as well as the areas for improvement to give balance to the appraisal."
Cite specific examples to demonstrate current performance as well as examples of behavior/results that might occur at the next higher level of performance.
Focus on the future by jointly developing a plan of action to improve performance.
Follow a problem solving approach.
Discuss key areas for improvement by defining specific solutions to performance issues without assigning blame.
Manage the emotions involved with evaluating performance.
"Allow the employee to communicate his or her concerns, listen carefully to the concerns, and provide constructive feedback."
"In some cases, it may be useful to postpone the remainder of the meeting so both participants can regroup."
"If disagreements cannot be resolved between the employee and the supervisor, the employee may provide a written response, which becomes an attachment to the performance agreement."
The supervisor should inform the employee about the effect of the rating of record on the salary review process under an IRS Payband System.
The employee should sign and date the performance agreement at the conclusion of the performance appraisal meeting.
"After current performance has been discussed, the supervisor may decide that it would be useful to discuss the expectations for the next appraisal cycle by conducting the activities outlined in Step 1, Planning Expectations."
Often a separate meeting is required to plan future performance goals and should be scheduled as soon as practical.
"6.430.3.7.1 (10-28-2011)
Evaluation of Managerial Potential
Supervisors are also required to discuss Form 13236, Evaluation of Managerial Potential (EMP)."
The EMP is completed at the end of each appraisal period to identify leadership competencies for development and to determine potential in the competitive process.
Recently many managers completed the four stages of the Leadership Succession Review (LSR) assessment which also identifies leadership competencies for development.
"Until further notice, managers who have completed all four stages of the LSR will not be required to complete the EMP annually as part of the appraisal process."
Managers who have not completed all four stages of the LSR assessment will continue to complete the EMP as part of the annual appraisal process.
Note: In the near future the EMP will be obsoleted and be replaced with LSR leadership competency ratings in the Merit System Promotion competitive process.
"Management officials, confidential management/program analysts, and other first time applicants for management positions may request the form be completed at any time; however, once completed, their EMP will remain in effect for the duration of their performance cycle."
"For additional information on the EMP form, visit the Management Selection Program Resource Center web site at http:/hco.web.irs.gov/recruitstaff/internalplac/meritpromo/msp/index.html."
"6.430.3.8 (06-12-2009)
Processing the Signed Performance Appraisal
Both the rating official and approving official must sign the performance appraisal for it to be used as the rating of record."
"The approving official has the final authority to approve, modify, or disapprove the summary evaluation rating."
The employee is not required to sign the performance appraisal.
"If the employee chooses not to sign, the supervisor should document the employee's refusal."
The supervisor should inform the employee that refusal to acknowledge receipt of the appraisal does not render the rating of record invalid.
"The original, completed performance agreement form must be filed in the employees EPF along with any back-up documentation and any accompanying narratives or self-assessments."
The supervisor must ensure that the employees annual appraisal is entered into the Services automated performance appraisal system by the required date.
"6.430.3.9 (10-28-2011)
Tracking Performance Agreements
The supervisor should review and take actions based on the information provided in ePerformance or based on the information provided in the Pay Period Performance Management Listings Reports available on the HR Reporting Center website."
"ePerformance reports provide information to the supervisor related to performance management responsibilities including:
Printable Performance Plans."
Award Election Report.
Status Summary Report.
Missing Performance Documents.
Performance Document Status.
Documents Pending Rating Review.
The Pay Period Performance Management Listings Reports are available to each supervisor and each business unit via the HR Reporting Center website.
Supervisors may initiate an OL5081 for access as appropriate for their business unit.
"These reports provide information to the supervisor related to performance management responsibilities including:
Annual ratings due/overdue status,
Employee due/overdue eligibility status for WIGI, and
Last rating of record and rating dates input in the automated personnel system."
"6.430.3.10 (10-28-2011)
Reconsidering the Summary Evaluation
Employees are encouraged to resolve matters of disagreement concerning the summary evaluation with their rating official and approving official."
"An employee who is dissatisfied with his or her summary evaluation may ask for reconsideration from the approving official in lieu of, or in addition to, adding comments to the evaluation."
"If the informal problem solving, as described in (2), is not successful, managers, management officials, and confidential management/program analysts may request reconsideration of their performance appraisal by filing an agency grievance within the time specified in IRM 6.771.1, Internal Revenue Service, Agency Grievance System (AGS)."
"Managers, management officials, and confidential management/program analysts should follow the IRS Agency Grievance System procedures specified in IRM 6.771.1, to request reconsideration of their performance appraisals."
Employees may also consult their servicing Labor Relations/Employee Relations Office to discuss reconsideration procedures.
Any change to the overall rating must be reviewed against the critical performance expectations of the position to ensure the appropriateness of the changed rating.
"6.430.3.11 (06-12-2009)
Amending a Rating
A rating may be amended after it is given to the employee for reasons such as:
Reconsideration by the rating official resulting from an informal request by the employee within 60 days of issuance."
Discovery of an error in recording or calculating the rating of record.
Changes directed as the resolution of a formal complaint procedure.
A change in the employee's performance after the end of the appraisal period is not a justification for amending a rating.
"The following steps should be followed to amend a rating of Record:
The supervisor selects Rework Rating from the document in ePerformance."
The appraisal period remains the same as the original.
"All parties of the original rating should sign the amended rating (employee, rating official, and reviewing official)."
The amended rating must not contain documentation in any section of the form that would indicate the evaluation is the result of a grievance or any similar action.
(This includes the performance notes section of the online document.)
The original copy of the amended form should be placed in the employees EPF.
The previous rating will be destroyed and replaced with the corrected rating.
"6.430.3.12 (10-28-2011)
Step 4: Recognizing Performance
The supervisor may recognize strong performance through informal acknowledgements and formal recognition."
Note: See IRM 6.451 Employee Performance and Utilization - Awards and Recognition or the Awards and Recognition web page at http://hco.web.irs.gov/perfmgmt/awards/index.html for additional information.
Newly-hired employees covered by the IRS Payband System who do not meet the IRS minimum appraisal period or do not have a rating of record from another Federal agency for the current performance appraisal period will not be eligible for a performance bonus or performance-based increase.
"However, employees with a rating of record from another Federal agency or a rating based on another IRS pay system (e.g., GS, WG) will be eligible for the lowest performance-based increase granted and may be eligible for a performance award based on their prior award program."
Note: See the Payband Resource Center for Managers for more information on manager performance bonuses at http://hco.web.irs.gov/apps/payband/index.htm .

6.430.4.1 (01-01-2007)
Overview of Performance and Reduction in Force
Performance is one of the four retention factors used in reduction in force (RIF) as outlined in 5 USC 3501 - 3503."
This IRM section specifies the policies and procedures that the IRS uses in determining the proper retention service credit for performance ratings in a competitive area undergoing a RIF.
"6.430.4.2 (01-01-2007)
Performance Appraisals Used for RIF
Only a rating of record or an equivalent rating of record may be used as the basis for granting retention service credit in RIF."
"An equivalent rating of record means a performance evaluation not given under 5 CFR 430, Subpart B, but meeting the following requirements:
Was issued as an officially designated evaluation under the employing agency's performance evaluation system."
Was derived from the appraisal of performance against expectations that were established and communicated in advance and were work related.
Identified whether the employee performed acceptably.
"To be used as the employee's rating of record, an IRS performance appraisal must:
Be completed on an officially designated performance appraisal form appropriate to the employee's position of record."
Contain the signatures of the rating official/rater and reviewing/approving official.
Have been provided to the employee.
Contain an overall rating or summary evaluation and a rating for the Retention Standard for the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers (when appropriate).
Be based on the evaluation of actual job performance for the designated appraisal period.
Be retained by the rating official in the employee's Employee Performance File (EPF).
Be entered into the Service's automated personnel system.
"Ratings of Record from other Federal agencies and Treasury bureaus may be accepted for RIF purposes if they are given under the requirements of Subpart B, Part 430, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations or meet the requirements of an equivalent rating of record specified above."
"6.430.4.3 (01-01-2007)
Amount of Credit for Performance
Each employee in a competitive area undergoing a RIF receives additional retention service credit for performance based on the average of the employee's three most recent ratings of record received the 4-year period prior to the date the IRS freezes ratings before issuing specific RIF notices."
"The IRS will provide additional retention service credit to the employees under the same summary rating pattern in additional years of service on the basis of the mathematical average of each employee's ratings of record:
20 additional years of service for each rating of record of "" Outstanding"" or equivalent summary (Level 5);
16 additional years of service for each rating of record of "" Exceeds Fully Successful"" or equivalent summary (Level 4); and
12 additional years of service for each rating of record of "" Fully Successful"" or equivalent summary (Level 3)."
"The IRS may not give any additional retention service credit for ratings of record of ""Minimally Successful"" or equivalent (Level 2), or ""Unacceptable"" or equivalent summary (Level 1)."
"If the average is a fraction, the Service will round up the fraction to the next higher whole number."
"6.430.4.4 (05-06-2011)
Use of a Cutoff Date in RIF
The IRS has established the use of a cutoff date of a minimum of 60 days prior to the planned issuance of the specific RIF notices to freeze ratings of record from being used in a RIF."
The purpose of the cutoff date is to provide sufficient time to properly determine employees' retention standings prior to a RIF.
The cutoff date must be stated as a specified number of days occurring prior to the issuance of the specific RIF notices.
"After this cutoff date, no new ratings of record may be put on the record and used for RIF purposes."
"Ratings of record received after the cutoff date may still be used for other purposes such as awards, merit promotion actions, etc."
"Note: To be put ""on the record"" means the completed valid performance appraisal is entered into the Service's automated personnel system and is available for use in a RIF."
The performance appraisal cutoff date may be longer than 60 days based on the results of negotiations with the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU).
No annual performance appraisal will be completed before the ending date of the employee's appraisal period to circumvent the specified cutoff date.
"The only exceptions to the prohibition of early appraisals are:
A departure appraisal prepared for an employee who permanently departs his or her position within the last 60 days of the employee's appraisal period."
A departure appraisal prepared for an employee whose supervisor is departing his or her position within the last 60 days of the employee's appraisal period.
Note: These departure appraisals become the employee's rating of record.
See IRM 6.430.2.5.1 and 6.430.3.5.1 for more information on departure appraisals used as ratings of record.
"6.430.4.5 (01-01-2007)
Missing Ratings of Record
If an employee in a competitive area undergoing a RIF has not received three actual ratings of record during the applicable 4-year period prior to the date the IRS freezes ratings, the IRS provides additional retention service credit using the following procedures:
An employee who has received at least one but fewer than three previous ratings of record during the applicable 4-year period receives retention service credit for performance on the basis of the value of the actual rating(s) of record divided by the number of actual ratings received."
An employee who has not received any rating of record during the applicable 4-year period receives retention service credit for performance based on the modal rating for the summary level pattern that applies to the employee's official position of record at the time of the RIF.
"Examples : The modal rating would be necessary for an employee who did not receive a rating of record for a variety of reasons (e.g., active military duty, injury compensation, an assignment under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act, work on behalf of a collective bargaining unit, or insufficient time in a pay status for a seasonal employee)."
"6.430.4.6 (01-01-2007)
Use of the Modal Rating
The modal rating is the summary rating level assigned most frequently among the actual ratings of record that are:
Assigned under the summary level pattern that applies to the employee's official position of record on the date of the RIF."
Given within the same competitive area.
On the record (issued to the employee with all appropriate reviews and signatures).
For the most recently completed appraisal period prior to the cutoff date the IRS specifies prior to the issuance of notices after which no new ratings will be put on the record.
The IRS bases the modal rating on the competitive area undergoing a RIF.
"At the time a RIF is contemplated for a competitive area, the Service will review the affected employees' records to determine if the use of modal ratings will be necessary."
"If one or more employees in the competitive area do not have at least one rating of record during the previous 4- year period, the modal rating is calculated separately for each competitive area facing a RIF."
There is no requirement for the IRS either to determine or to use modal ratings when every employee in the competitive area has at least one rating of record during the applicable 4-year time period.
The modal rating can only used for RIF purposes.
"6.430.4.7 (01-01-2007)
Multiple Rating Patterns
Although all IRS employees have five summary rating levels (e.g."
"""Outstanding,"" ""Exceeds Fully Successful"" ) based on their IRS performance, some employees in a competitive area may have performance ratings from other Federal agencies or Treasury bureaus."
These performance ratings may be under more than one pattern of summary levels as specified in 5 CFR 430.208.
"In the event that a competitive area undergoing a RIF has employees with ratings of record under other summary rating patterns, the IRS is required to consider the mix of rating patterns and to specify additional retention service credit for employees who have the same summary level, but are under different patterns."
The range of additional service credit is still limited from 12 to 20 years.
Exhibit 6.430.4-1 shows the amount of additional years of retention service credit for performance provided to employees undergoing a RIF and who have a different summary rating pattern.

6.430.5.1 (06-12-2009)
Coverage
This section describes the manner in which employees who are serving on temporary assignments anticipated to last 60 days or more receive performance appraisals that may become ratings of record."
"Temporary assignments include temporary promotions whether competitive or non competitive, and details to a different position with a not to exceed date."
The requirements of this section are intended to be read in context with the remainder of IRM 6.430.
"6.430.5.2 (01-01-2007)
General Requirements
An employee on a temporary assignment within the Service such as a detail or temporary promotion must receive a performance plan as soon as possible (no later than 30 days) from the beginning of each temporary assignment expected to last at least 60 days."
The performance plan should reflect the employee’s performance expectations for the duration of the temporary assignment.
"Although a temporary assignment may not be anticipated to last 60 days, management must provide to the employee a performance plan once the temporary assignment is expected to last at least 60 days."
A departure appraisal reflecting the employee’s performance on a temporary assignment of 60 days or more must be prepared by the supervisor of the employee’s temporary assignment position when the employee departs the temporary assignment.
These departure appraisals do not require the reviewing official’s signature since they will not become the employee’s rating of record.
The supervisor of the employee’s position of record must consider all departure appraisals for temporary assignments that occurred during the appraisal period when preparing the employee’s annual rating of record.
Mid-year progress reviews are required even if the employee is serving on a detail or temporary promotion.
"Normally, the permanent supervisor will be responsible for conducting the progress review."
"However, when the employee is serving on a long-term temporary assignment, it may be more appropriate for the supervisor of the employee’s temporary assignment to conduct a progress review."
"Note: For additional information on mid-year progress reviews, see IRM 6.430.2.3.2 for employees evaluated by critical job elements and IRM 6.430.3.3.1 for managers and management officials."
Management should consider the effect on performance appraisals when temporarily assigning employees for extended periods.
"6.430.5.3 (06-12-2009)
Appraisals for Temporary Promotions to GS Positions
These requirements for appraisals for temporary promotions only apply to GS and Internal Revenue (IR) employees who are temporarily promoted to GS and equivalent positions (e.g., WG, GM, and GL)."
Temporary promotions of employees that involve movement into or within the IR payband are covered by the requirements found in IRM 6.430.5.5.1.
An employee who receives a temporary promotion to a position that is anticipated to last for 60 days or more will receive a performance plan reflecting the performance expectations of the temporary promotion position.
"Normally, the employee’s permanent supervisor will prepare the employee’s rating of record on the performance plan of employee’s permanent position."
This rating of record will include feedback from the temporary promotion supervisor as appropriate.
"Exception: The supervisor of the employee’s temporary promotion position will prepare the rating of record on the performance plan of the temporary promotion position if the following two conditions are met:

The temporary promotion was of sufficient duration that the employee is not ratable for the permanent position (i.e., less than 60 days of performance during the appraisal period), and
The employee’s performance appraisal period ended while the employee was serving in the temporary promotion position."
Employees who are temporarily promoted into a position for 60 days or more assume the performance appraisal period ending date of the temporary assignment.
"However, the employee will not receive a rating of record for the temporary promotion position unless the conditions described in IRM 6.430.5.3 (3 ) above are met (i.e., the employee does not meet the minimum performance period to be rated for the permanent position)."
Example 1 - A bargaining unit employee on a performance appraisal cycle based on the employee’s SSN receives a temporary promotion for 120 days to another bargaining unit position.
"While in the temporary assignment, the employee’s performance appraisal period ends based on the employee’s SSN."
"As long as the employee had at least 60 days of performance in the permanent position at the end of the employee’s appraisal period, the employee would receive a rating of record based on the permanent position."
The employee’s temporary promotion supervisor would provide performance feedback to the employee’s permanent supervisor for consideration in the employee’s next rating of record.
Example 2 – A management official on the fiscal year performance appraisal cycle receives a temporary promotion to a bargaining unit position for 120 days.
"While in this temporary assignment, the employee’s performance appraisal period ends based on the SSN cycle."
"Since the employee served at least 60 days in the permanent position at the end of the performance appraisal period based on the SSN cycle, the employee would not receive a rating of record based on the performance plan for the temporary promotion position but remain on the performance appraisal cycle of the permanent position."
It is possible for an employee to receive more than one rating of record in a year based on movement between a permanent position and a temporary promotion position with a different performance appraisal cycle.
Each rating of record is considered valid for the period covered even though the appraisal period is less than one year for an employee with multiple ratings of record during the annual appraisal period.
"In addition, none of the performance appraisal periods for these ratings of record may overlap."
"In these cases, the employee’s most recently completed rating of record becomes the employee’s current rating of record for all purposes such as reduction in force, awards, and merit promotion."
Example: A bargaining unit employee with an appraisal period of December 1 to November 30 receives a temporary promotion to a supervisory position for the period of January 1 to September 30.
The employee’s temporary promotion appraisal period now ends on September 30 (fiscal year cycle).
"The employee receives a rating of record on October 1 on the Manager Performance Agreement because:


The performance period ends while the employee is on temporary promotion, and
The employee is not ratable for the permanent position since the employee has less than 60 days of performance in that position during the appraisal period."
The employee returns to his or her permanent bargaining unit position on October 1.
"On November 30, the employee’s appraisal period ends for the permanent bargaining unit position and the employee’s receives a new rating of record on Form 6850-BU for the period of October 1 to November 30 since this period meets the minimum appraisal period of 60 days."
This November 30 performance appraisal becomes the employee’s current rating of record.
"If the performance appraisal period does not end while the employee is on the temporary promotion, the employee will receive a departure appraisal from the temporary promotion supervisor for any assignment that lasted 60 days or more."
This departure appraisal is furnished to the employee’s permanent supervisor for consideration in the employee’s next scheduled rating of record.
"For more information on appraisals for temporary promotions from IR positions to GS positions, see the Job Aid Rating Employees on Temporary Promotions IR to GS found at http://hco.web.irs.gov/pdf/irtempromojobaid.PDF."
"6.430.5.4 (06-12-2009)
Appraisals for Details to GS Positions
These requirements for appraisals for details apply to GS and equivalent positions (e.g., WG, GM, GL) only."
"Details of IR payband employees that involve movement into, within, or out of the payband are covered by the requirements found in IRM 6.430.5.5.2."
An employee detailed to a position that is expected to last 60 days or more will receive a performance plan reflecting the performance expectations of the detail.
The employee will receive a departure appraisal from the supervisor of the detail position for his or her performance at the end of any detail that lasted 60 days or more.
This departure appraisal is furnished to the employee’s permanent supervisor for consideration in the employee’s next scheduled rating of record.
A departure appraisal for performance on a detail can never be used as the employee’s rating of record.
The supervisor of an employee’s detail assignment cannot prepare the employee’s annual performance appraisal that is used as the rating of record.
An employee detailed to another position maintains the performance period ending date of the permanent position.
Example: A bargaining unit employee whose performance cycle is based on the SSN is detailed to a management official position for one year.
"Although the management official’s performance appraisal period is based on the fiscal year, the employee retains the SSN cycle and receives an annual appraisal based on his or her SSN."
The detailed employee’s annual appraisal is completed on the employee’s permanent performance plan by the permanent supervisor with feedback received from the supervisor of the detail.
The employee’s permanent supervisor must request and obtain a departure appraisal from the employee’s detail supervisor.
It is the responsibility of the employee’s permanent supervisor as the rating official to ensure that the employee’s accomplishments on the detail are considered in the employee’s annual appraisal as appropriate.
"6.430.5.5 (06-12-2009)
Appraisals for Temporary Assignments of IR Payband Employees
It is the IRS policy to compensate an employee occupying an IR payband position consistent with the employee’s performance as it is measured by the annual summary performance evaluation."
The pay is designed to recognize performance in accordance with the pay administration rules for the IR paybands.
Performance appraisals for temporary assignments for IR payband employees that involve movement out of the payband for an extended period require special considerations since the employee’s performance as reflected in the performance appraisal has significant impact on the employee’s pay.
It is important for management to be aware of the performance management ramifications of temporary assignments in and out of payband positions to ensure employees are not adversely affected by these temporary assignments.
IRM 6.430.5 does not address the IRS policies on pay administration for IR paybands.
"For more information on pay administration for IR paybands, see the Staffing and Pay Administration Policies for the IRS Payband System, (PPD-9509-02P12) at http://hco.web.irs.gov/policies/intrmguide/1perpolicy.html."
More information on IR paybands for IRS managers may be found in the Manager's Payband Resource Center at http://hco.web.irs.gov/apps/payband/index.htm.
"6.430.5.5.1 (01-01-2007)
Appraisals for Temporary Promotions to IR Positions
These requirements for appraisals for temporary promotions which involve movement into or within the IR payband apply to IR employees only."
Temporary promotions of employees into the GS system are covered by the requirements found in IRM 6.430.5.3.
"A GS employee serving on a temporary promotion to an IR position or an IR employee serving on a temporary promotion to a higher IR position at the end of the appraisal period (i.e., September 30) will be evaluated on the employee’s permanent GS or IR position."
"Exception: If the employee is not ratable for his or her permanent position (i.e., the employee has not served the minimum appraisal period of 60 days), the employee will be evaluated on the IR temporary promotion position."
The employee will be placed in the bonus pool that covers the position on which the employee’s annual rating of record was based.
Example: A bargaining unit employee who has a performance appraisal cycle based on the employee’s SSN is temporarily promoted to an IR manager position for one year.
"While serving on the temporary promotion, the performance appraisal period for managers ends on September 30."
"As long as the employee did not have 60 days or more of performance in the permanent position on September 30, the employee would receive a rating of record based on the IR manager temporary promotion position prepared by the supervisor of the temporary promotion position."
"In the event that a GS or IR employee received more than one IR temporary promotion during the appraisal period and is not ratable for that employee’s permanent position, the employee will receive his or her annual rating of record based on the IR temporary promotion position of the longest duration that occurred during the appraisal period."
The employee will be placed in the bonus pool that covers the temporary IR position on which the employee’s annual rating of record was based.
"For more information on appraisals for temporary promotions to IR positions, see the Job Aid Rating Employees on Temporary Promotions IR to IR and GS to IR found at http://hco.web.irs.gov/pdf/irtemppromojobaid.PDF
6.430.5.5.2 (06-12-2009)
Appraisals for Details to, from, or within IR Positions
These requirements for appraisals for details that involve movement into, within, or out of the IR payband apply to IR positions only."
Details of GS employees are covered by the requirements found in IRM 6.430.5.4.
An IR employee who receives a detail to a GS or IR position that is anticipated to last for 60 days or more will receive a performance plan reflecting the performance expectations of the detail position.
"Normally, the employee’s permanent supervisor will prepare the employee’s rating of record on the performance plan of the employee’s permanent position."
This rating of record will include feedback from the detail supervisor as appropriate.
"Exceptions :
Details to IR Positions - A GS or IR employee either competitively or non-competitively detailed to an IR position and who is unratable in the permanent GS or IR position of record (i.e., the employee has not served the minimum appraisal period of 60 days) will be evaluated based on performance in the detail IR position."
The employee's salary will be included in the organization's bonus pool for performance bonuses and special act awards for IR employees in the detail position.
"Details from IR Positions - An employee occupying an IR position who is either competitively or non-competitively detailed to a GS position and who is unratable in the permanent IR position of record (i.e., the employee has not served the minimum appraisal period of 60 days) will be evaluated based on performance in the detail GS position."
The employee will be eligible for a performance award or special act award if the provisions applicable to GS employees covered by that performance appraisal program permit it.
"Since the employee did not receive an IR performance appraisal, the employee's salary will not be included in the bonus pool for performance bonuses and special act awards applicable to the employee's IR position."
"For more information on appraisals for details to or from IR positions, see the Job Aid, Rating Employees on Extended Details, IR to IR, IR to GS, or GS to IR found at http://hco.web.irs.gov/pdf/irjobaidevaldetail.PDF."

"This is the standard of proof the IRS must meet when taking a suspension for more than 14 days, removal, reduction in grade/band or pay, or a furlough for 30 days or less."
(39) Prior Offense - A previously imposed penalty which is still a matter of record.
"An employee’s past discipline record may be reviewed when considering Douglas Factor 3, Disciplinary Record."
"Note: Third parties consistently use the following three-part test to determine if an adverse action counts as past discipline (see Bolling v. Air Force, 9 MSPR 335, 339-340 (1981)):

Appellant was informed of the action in writing

The action is a matter of record, and

Appellant was given the opportunity to dispute the charge(s) to a higher level than the authority who imposed the discipline."
"(40) Progressive Discipline - The penalty for misconduct is tailored to the facts and circumstances; however, escalating penalties may be imposed for repeat misconduct."
"Progressive discipline is not required, and subsequent offenses may or may not be the same or like the prior offense."
"When using progressive discipline and considering Douglas Factor 3, Past Disciplinary Record, the prior penalty must still be a matter of record."
"(41) Proposing Official - The manager with the delegated authority to propose a suspension, removal reduction in grade/band or pay, or a furlough of 30 days or less."
"See IRM 6.752.1.8, Delegation of Authority."
(42) Reduction in Grade/Band - The involuntary assignment of an employee to a position at a lower classification level under a position classification system.
(43) Reduction in Pay - An involuntary reduction in the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by the employee.
"Reduction in pay does not include the involuntary loss of any differentials such as standby pay, night work, overtime, hazardous duty, or holiday pay."
(44) Removal - An involuntary separation based on the decision of a delegated authority which terminates the employer-employee relationship.
"(45) Reprimand - A disciplinary action used when an action to address misconduct warrants an action more severe than an admonishment, but less severe than a suspension or an action involving a loss of grade/pay."
Letters of reprimand are filed in an employee’s OPF.
(46) Standard Form 50 (SF-50) - A Notification of Personnel Action that contains certain employment information.
It is a permanent document that is filed in an employee’s OPF.
"See Document 12787, SF-50: Notification of Personnel Action – An Overview."
"(47) Substantial Evidence - The degree of relevant evidence that a reasonable person, considering the record as a whole, might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even though other reasonable persons might disagree."
This is a lower standard of proof than preponderance of the evidence and is the standard of proof the IRS must meet when taking a suspension of 14 days or less.
(48) Suspension - The placement of an employee in a temporary status without duties or pay for misconduct.
Suspensions served solely on non-duty days do not meet the definition of suspension.
"Note: In compliance with 5 CFR 752.601, Coverage, Senior Executive Service (SES) employees may not be suspended for 14 days or less."

Delegation of Authority
(1) See IRM 1.2.2, Servicewide Delegations of Authority, for Delegation Order 6-29, Authority to Address Employee Performance or Conduct Issues."
"Note: If the subject of a corrective action is on a:
1."
Temporary assignment recorded on an SF-50 - The delegated authority(s) is the management chain for the employee’s temporary assignment.
2.
Detail/assignment that is not recorded on an SF-50 - The delegated authority(s) is the management chain for the employee’s permanent position of record.
"Note: CI employees see IRM 1.2.2.7.18.1, Criminal Investigation Deviation from Servicewide Delegation Order 6-29, Authority to Address Employee Performance or Conduct Issues."
"6.752.1.9 (12-13-2024)
Concept of Discipline
(1) Employees are expected to follow the ethics rules from the Office of Government Ethics, the Department of the Treasury, and the IRS (see Document 12011, IRS Ethics Handbook, and IRM 6.735, Ethics Matters)."
"The absence of a specific rule covering an act that discredits an employee or the IRS, does not mean that such an act is condoned or allowed."
Employees are also expected to follow work procedures to accomplish the IRS mission.
Failure to follow the ethics rules or performance procedures may result in a corrective action.
(2) Management’s right to discipline employees is covered in 5 USC 7106(a)(2)(A).
(3) Management issues a corrective action when called for by the employee’s misconduct.
"(4) The IRS does not use a standard schedule of offenses and penalties; however, the Penalty Guide (Document 11500) is available to assist management in determining appropriate penalties."
The guide does not cover all offenses.
"If an offense is not listed, it does not mean a penalty cannot be imposed."
"Except for mandatory penalties required by law, such as misuse of a government vehicle or violations of RRA ’98, the penalties suggested are guidelines, not a rigid standard."
"Deviations from the guide are allowed and greater or lesser penalties may be imposed, based on the facts of the case."
"Note: Certain offenses carry penalties mandated by law, rule, regulation, or IRS policy."
"For example, RRA ’98 violations require removal; misuse of a government vehicle violations require a 30-day suspension (see 31 USC 1349, Adverse personnel actions); the willful unauthorized access, attempted access or inspection of taxpayer records violations require removal (see IRM 10.5.5, IRS Unauthorized Access, Attempted Access or Inspection of Taxpayer Records (UNAX) Program Policy, Guidance, and Requirements)."
"(5) When contemplating a corrective action, management considers each case individually based on its own merits and supporting evidence."
"6.752.1.10 (12-13-2024)
Prohibition Against Discrimination
(1) Under no circumstances shall discipline be based on race, color, sex (including sexual orientation, gender identity, and pregnancy), parental status, religion, national origin, age (40 or older), disability (mental or physical), genetic information, marital status, political affiliation, or reprisal for protected activity."
The IRS also prohibits retaliation for engaging in the EEO process.
"6.752.1.11 (12-13-2024)
Management Investigation
(1) Incidents of misconduct come to management’s attention in a variety of ways."
"Management may:

Observe misconduct

Receive information from another employee or supervisor

Have physical evidence an employee engaged in misconduct, or

Receive information from TIGTA or LERN."
(2) Managers must address misconduct immediately and contact LERN for guidance.
Contacting LERN ensures managers follow policy and procedures.
"It also ensures compliance with IRM 6.332.2.4, Prior Performance & Misconduct Check/Screening."
"(3) Before scheduling an interview with a BU employee to discuss a misconduct matter, managers must consult with LERN to understand their responsibilities under Article 5, Section 4, of the National Agreement."
"See 5 USC 7114(a)(2)(B), sometimes referred to as Weingarten Rights, per NLRB v. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U.S. 251 (1975)."
"(4) During interviews with employees to discuss misconduct, if the employee refuses to respond to questions, management will advise them per 31 CFR 0.210."
"As directed, employees must respond to questions truthfully and under oath when required, whether orally or in writing, and must provide documents and other materials concerning matters of official interest when directed to do so by competent Treasury authority (for example, TIGTA or an IRS manager)."
"Failure to respond or provide documents, as directed, may result in corrective action."
"6.752.1.12 (12-13-2024)
TIGTA Investigation
(1) TIGTA initiates conduct investigations based on complaints or allegations about employees originating from management, taxpayers, taxpayer representatives, or allegations made by IRS employees."
"(2) Any allegation or information that an employee may have committed a crime must be promptly reported to TIGTA (see IRM 6.735.1.3, Reporting Ethics Violations)."
Management must not conduct their own investigation into these matters unless authorized by TIGTA.
"(3) Referral of TIGTA’s Reports of Investigations (ROI) is only made on a “need to know” basis; however, ROIs are sent to managers with the delegated authority to issue corrective action."
All persons must treat the ROI in a confidential manner.
"(4) If management thinks the ROI requires clarification, development of more facts, or further investigation, they will contact their assigned LERN specialist for guidance."
"(5) Upon TIGTA’s release of a ROI to the IRS for adjudication, the IRS is authorized to use, copy, and release relevant portions when appropriate."
Management may only keep a copy of the report for the matter being adjudicated.
"6.752.1.13 (12-13-2024)
Burden of Proof
(1) When taking an admonishment, reprimand, or a suspension of less than 14 days, the IRS must prove by ""substantial evidence"" that the employee engaged in the misconduct described in writing."
"See IRM 6.752.1.4, Terms and Acronyms, for definition of substantial evidence."
"(2) When taking a suspension of more than 14 days, removal, reduction in grade/band or pay, or furlough for 30 days or less, the IRS must prove by a “preponderance of evidence” that the employee engaged in the misconduct described in the Advance Notice."
"See IRM 6.752.1.4, Terms and Acronyms, for a definition of preponderance of evidence."
"Note: For the action to be sustained, the IRS must prove the efficiency of the service was or could have been adversely impacted by the misconduct, and the penalty was within the bounds of reasonableness."
"(3) An appellant has the burden to prove the IRS committed a harmful error in their suspension of more than 14 days, removal, reduction in grade/band or pay, or furlough for 30 days or less."
"6.752.1.14 (12-13-2024)
Alternative Discipline (AD)
(1) AD is a non-traditional approach to correct misconduct."
"(2) AD objectives:

Modify unacceptable behavior

Prevent future conduct issues, and

Achieve results with less time and resources."
"(3) Per Article 38, Section 2, of the National Agreement, management must offer AD to BU employees if they determine a letter of reprimand or suspension of 1 to 14 days will be imposed/proposed."
"If management believes AD is a feasible option to correct the employee’s conduct issue, discussions must occur prior to entering into an agreement or issuing a reprimand or proposal to suspend for less than 14 days."
"Management, the employee, and NTEU must agree on the AD."
"Note:
a) Management has the option of offering AD to NBU employees if they believe AD is a feasible option to correct the employee’s conduct issue."
"b) For SES employees, AD is only available when a letter of reprimand is recommended."
c) CI does not allow AD.
"(4) AD options may not be used in combination with traditional discipline, such as civic work plus a one-day suspension or preparing a research paper and issuance of a letter of reprimand."
(5) Management is not required to accept the AD suggested by the employee or their representative.
"(6) AD agreements must include the following:

A detailed description of the AD agreed to

A statement of the traditional penalty for which the AD is a substitute

A statement of the misconduct

A statement that the employee admits to engaging in the misconduct

A paragraph about the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (for employees aged 40 or older)

A statement permanently prohibiting the employee from working any type of telework and remote work if the misconduct involves Absence Without Leave for more than five days or at least 41 hours in any one calendar year, or viewing, downloading, or exchanging pornography, including child pornography, on a federal government computer or while performing official federal government duties."
"See IRM 6.800.2, IRS Telework Program, and, Interim Guidance Memorandum HCO-06-1022-0012, Interim Guidance on The IRS Future of Work Remote Work Project, dated March 6, 2023."
"And for BU employees, a statement that the employee and the union agree to waive their rights (that is, an oral and/or written reply, grievance, appeal, and complaints in any forum)."
"(7) If the employee violates the terms of the AD agreement (does not meet the requirements agreed upon), the penalty outlined in the AD agreement will be imposed immediately."
"For suspensions, an Advance Notice (proposal letter) is not issued."
"Instead, a decision letter is prepared outlining the reason(s) for the suspension."
"Per the terms of the AD agreement, the employee may not grieve the suspension; however, they (or the union for BU employees) may grieve whether the employee failed to comply with the terms of the AD agreement."
"6.752.1.15 (12-13-2024)
Last Rights/Voluntary Separations
(1) Management has the option of offering “Last Rights” to employees who may be issued a removal action taken under 5 CFR 752."
"(2) When an employee faces a potential removal action, they may choose to resign, retire, or request a change to lower grade prior to receiving the Advanced Notice/proposal letter."
"An employee’s decision to resign, retire, or request a change to lower grade, is voluntary."
"(3) If management decides to offer Last Rights to a BU employee prior to issuing a proposal letter, they must read Article 5, Section 5, of the National Agreement."
"(4) Management must contact their assigned LERN specialist (or LERN manager) before holding the Last Rights meeting to ensure adherence to policy and hiring compliance (for example, see IRM 6.332.2.4, Prior Performance & Misconduct Check/Screening)."
"Exception: In the event the LERN specialist/manager is not available, and management determines they must hold a Last Rights meeting with a NBU employee, management must contact their assigned LERN specialist/manager no later than the next workday to notify them the Last Rights meeting was held."
"6.752.1.16 (12-13-2024)
Employee Entitlements
(1) Alternative Discipline - If management is considering a reprimand or a suspension of 14 days or less, prior to taking the corrective action, management must inform a BU employee that “traditional” discipline is being contemplated and give the employee five workdays to request consideration of an alternative form of discipline (Alternative Discipline)."
"See IRM 6.752.1.14, Alternative Discipline."
Note: SES employees may not be suspended for 14 days or less.
"(2) Suspension, Removal, Reduction in grade/band or pay, Furlough of 30 days or less - If management proposes one of these actions, the employee is entitled to:

Advance Notice - A written notice (proposal letter) specifying the reason(s) and example(s) (also known as a specification) for the proposed action."
"See IRM 6.752.1.21, Advance Notice (Proposal Letter)."
"Opportunity to Answer (guidance included in the Advance Notice) - An employee and/or their representative may address the information covered in the Advance Notice by:

Requesting an oral reply within seven calendar days of receiving the Advance Notice."

"Per the procedures in 5 CFR 752.203, 5 CFR 752.404, and 5 CFR 752.604, the decision may only be based on the reason(s) specified in the Advance Notice."
"See IRM 6.752.1.30.1, Grieving or Appealing a Suspension or Removal, etc."
"6.752.1.17 (12-13-2024)
Employee’s Right to Representation
(1) For BU employees, Article 5 of the National Agreement, and 5 USC 7114 (2)(a)(B), states in part:

The IRS will not impose any restraint, interference, coercion, or discrimination against any employee who exercises their right to designate NTEU to represent them in matters concerning the interpretation or application of the National Agreement."
"A BU employee who is the subject of a conduct investigation or is being interviewed as a third-party witness, and who reasonably believes that an interview by a representative of the Employer, such as management or TIGTA, may result in discipline has the right to request representation by a person designated by NTEU."
"(2) For suspensions and above, all employees may choose to be represented by an attorney or other representative."
"See 5 CFR 752.203, 5 CFR 752.404 and 5 CFR 752.604."
"Per the National Agreement, BU employees may be represented by NTEU."
"(3) For letters of admonishment or reprimand, employees have the right to file a grievance in compliance with Article 41 of the Addendum to the National Agreement, for BU employees, or IRM 6.771.1, Agency Grievance System (AGS)."
"(4) For non-disciplinary actions, BU employees have the right to file a grievance if the action taken put the employee at a disadvantage (such as denial of an Alternate Work Schedule)."
(5) The employee’s written designation of a representative is provided to the manager named in the Advance Notice.
The manager provides a copy of the designation to their assigned LERN specialist.
"6.752.1.18 (12-13-2024)
Rights of Representatives
(1) Representatives may exercise their functions without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or coercion."
"(2) Per 5 USC 7114(a)(2)(A), BU employees may be represented by the union."
"For information and requirements for NTEU stewards to request time to represent BU employees in matters such as preparing for and presenting oral and/or written replies, see Article 8, Union Rights, in the National Agreement, Article 8, Union Rights, and see Article 9, Stewards and Official Time (covers time, travel, etc."
"), of the Addendum to the National Agreement."
"(3) Representatives are allowed a reasonable amount of time (bank, official, or administrative, as appropriate) to prepare for and present reply(ies) on behalf of the employee."
This includes time to review documents or interview other IRS employees on relevant matters.
"6.752.1.19 (12-13-2024)
Denial of Representative
(1) Per 5 CFR 752.203 and 5 CFR 752.404, the IRS will allow employees to be represented by an attorney or other representative unless such choice:

Creates a conflict of interest or position - This occurs when the representative’s IRS duties conflict with the functions of the representative."
"For example, if the requested representative participated in or has special knowledge about the matter by virtue of their assigned duties."
"Imposes unreasonable costs to the government - This can include any travel cost, or any expenses requested by the representative to fulfill their role."
Conflicts with the priority needs of the IRS - The IRS mission takes precedence.
The requested representative may be disallowed if their priority work assignment precludes their release from official duties.
"(2) Within five calendar days of receiving the employee’s written designation of representative, if management is disallowing the representative, they will provide the written disallowance to the employee and the disallowed representative."
"The written disallowance must include:

The reason(s) and specifics why the representative is being disallowed

Note: If the representative is disallowed due to a conflict of position, a copy of the position description in question must be included with the disallowance notice."
"The right to choose another representative, and

The right to appeal the disallowance."
(3) The employee (not the disallowed representative) may appeal the disallowance by submitting a written appeal (e-mail is acceptable) within five calendar days of receiving the disallowance notice.
"The appeal and a copy of the disallowance notice are sent to LERN’s Deputy Director, Field Operations."
"To find their name and contact information, go to Labor/Employee Relations & Negotiations Contacts."
"(4) Within 10 calendar days of receiving the disallowance appeal, LERN’s Deputy Director, Field Operations will send the employee a final decision to allow or disallow the representative."
"The final decision may not be grieved, and the corrective action will continue."
(5) The time periods must be enforced to avoid prolonging the Advance Notice period.
The Proposing Official should consider reasonable requests for more time to designate another representative.
"6.752.1.20 (12-13-2024)
Douglas Factors
(1) In Douglas v. Veterans Administration, 5 MSPR 280 (1981), the MSPB identified 12 factors (Douglas Factors) management must consider when determining an adverse action under 5 CFR 752."
"Note: The National Agreement combines two factors, Consistency with Other Penalties and Consistency with a Table of Penalties, and therefore identifies 11 factors."
"Note: For BU employees, Article 38 of the National Agreement, requires consideration of the Douglas Factors for admonishments and reprimands."
This provision does not apply to NBU employees.
"(2) Management must consider the relevant Douglas Factors for adverse actions under 5 CFR 752 that do not require a mandatory penalty (for example, misuse of a government vehicle or a Section 1203 violation)."
Some factors may weigh in the employee’s favor (mitigating factors) and others may constitute aggravating factors.
Management’s determination of the appropriate penalty is decided on a case-by-case basis.
"Note: When charging in the alternative, management must consider relevant Douglas Factors."
Alternative charges are based on the same set of facts.
"For example, the proposal letter states, you are charged with either violating Section 1203(b)(8) of the Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 or violating 5 CFR 2635.809, Just Financial Obligations."
"In this example, the Douglas Factors must be considered for the 5 CFR 2635.809 violation."
"(3) If an action is appealed to a third party, the Deciding Official will be questioned about their consideration of the relevant Douglas Factors, and they must be able to explain the reason for their penalty choice."
A third party will decide whether management considered all relevant factors and if the penalty choice was within the bounds of reasonableness.
"(4) The 12 Douglas Factors are:

Nature and Seriousness - The nature and seriousness of the offense and its relation to the employee’s duties, position, and responsibilities, including whether the offense was intentional or technical and inadvertent, or was committed maliciously or for gain, or was frequently repeated."
"Employeeʼs Job - The employee’s job level and type of employment, including supervisory or fiduciary role, contacts with the public, and prominence of the position."
Past Disciplinary Record - The employeeʼs past discipline record (disciplinary/adverse actions).
"Past Work Record - The employee’s past work record, including length of service, performance on the job, ability to get along with fellow workers, and dependability."
Effect on Future Performance - The effect of the offense upon the employee’s ability to perform at a satisfactory level and its effect upon supervisors’ confidence in the employee’s work ability to perform assigned duties.
Consistency with Other Penalties - Consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses.
"Note: When management considers this factor, they usually ensure the penalty is consistent with similarly situated employees within their work unit who committed the same/similar offense."
"However, in compliance with the MSPB’s precedential opinion, Singh v. USPS, 2022 MSPB 15, 2022 WL 1772249 (May 31, 2022), special circumstances may justify expanding the scope of the comparison to within the subject’s business unit or Servicewide."
"For example, if multiple employees commit misconduct together and they each report to a different supervisor/work unit, the comparison can be expanded outside the supervisory chain/work unit."
Consistency with Table of Penalties - Consistency of the penalty with a Table of Penalties if the agency has such a table (they are not required).
The IRS Table of Penalties is the Penalty Guide (Document 11500).
Notoriety and Impact - The notoriety of the offense or its impact upon the reputation of the IRS.
Clarity of Notice - The clarity with which the employee was on notice of any rules that were violated in committing the offense or had been warned about the conduct in question.
Potential for Rehabilitation - The potential for the employee’s rehabilitation.
"Mitigating Circumstances - Mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense such as unusual job tensions, personality problems, mental impairment, harassment, or bad faith, malice, or provocation on the part of others involved in the matter."
Alternative Sanctions - The adequacy and effectiveness of alternative sanctions to deter such conduct in the future by the employee or others.
(5) Any Douglas Factor considered by management must be specifically identified in the Advance Notice and the decision letter.
A generic statement about management’s consideration of the relevant Douglas Factors must be included in admonishments or reprimands for BU employees.
(6) Contact the assigned LERN specialist for guidance about considering the Douglas Factors.
"6.752.1.21 (12-13-2024)
Advance Notice (Proposal Letter)
(1) Suspensions of 14 days or less - Per 5 CFR 752.203, management must provide an employee with written Advance Notice before effecting a suspension of 14 days or less."
"Under Article 38 of the National Agreement, the written notice specifying the reason(s) for the proposed action must be issued to BU employees 15 calendar days before effecting the action."
The 15-calendar day notice period also applies to NBU employees.
The Advance Notice is not grievable.
Note: The calculation of days begins the day after the notice is delivered.
"If the deadline falls on a non-workday, the deadline is extended to the next workday."
"(2) Suspensions of more than 14 days, removals, reductions in grade or pay, furlough of 30 days or less - Per 5 CFR 752.404, management must provide an employee with written Advance Notice, which specifies the reason(s) for the proposed action, 30 calendar days before effecting these types of adverse actions (see Article 39 of the National Agreement, for BU employees)."
The Advance Notice is not grievable.
Note: The calculation of days begins the day after the notice is delivered.
"If the deadline falls on a non-workday, the deadline is extended to the next workday."
"Note: If there is reasonable cause to believe the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, the Advance Notice period may be shortened, per 5 CFR 752.404."
"See IRM 6.752.1.22, Crime Provision (Exception to 30-day Advance Notice Period)."
(3) The Advance Notice of proposed action is drafted by a LERN specialist.
"It is reviewed, approved, and issued by the manager with the delegated authority (Proposing Official)."
"See IRM 6.752.1.8, Delegation of Authority."
"(4) Management must work with their assigned LERN specialist to ensure the contents of the Advance Notice follow law, rule, regulation, and for BU employees, the National Agreement."
Failure to include required information may result in the MSPB reversing the action taken.
"(5) An Advance Notice proposing a suspension, removal, reduction in grade/band or pay, or a furlough of 30 days or less will include, as applicable, the following information:

A statement that the proposal letter is issued per 5 CFR 752

A statement that the proposed action promotes the efficiency of the service

A statement that the action may be taken at any time after the Advance Notice period

The proposed action, including the number of calendar days for a proposed suspension

The reason(s) and specification(s) for the proposed action

A statement that a final decision will be issued after the reply periods passes, any replies are considered, and the Advanced Notice period expires."
"For BU employees only, include a statement that the NTEU chapter who represents the employee and the NTEU National Field Office will simultaneously receive a redacted copy of the Advance Notice (that is, personally identifiable information and information protected by the Internal Revenue Code is removed), per Articles 38 and 39 of the National Agreement."
"See IRM 6.752.1.28, Redacting Letters with Personally Identifiable Information."
"Note: If a taxpayer key is attached to the employee’s proposal letter, it is not provided with the simultaneous delivery."
"The information can be requested in compliance with IRM 6.752.1.29, Guidelines for Identifying and Releasing Tax Information for Use in a Personnel Matter."
"Note: If the conduct involves the employee’s personal tax matter, generalized tax information is provided with the simultaneous delivery in compliance with the 2009 IRS-NTEU Settlement Agreement regarding overly sanitized letters."
Contact the assigned LERN specialist for more information.
"See IRM 6.752.1.28, Redacting Letters with Personally Identifiable Information."
(6) Management delivers the Advance Notice to the employee in person when possible.
"If personal delivery is not possible/appropriate (for example, the manager would need to travel since the employee is not co-located with them), management delivers the Advance Notice by encrypted e-mail."
Management asks the employee to acknowledge receipt of the notice with their signature and date.
"If the employee refuses to acknowledge receipt, the manager delivering the notice attests to delivering the notice by signing and dating it and includes the following statement: Employee refused to acknowledge receipt; hand delivered [or emailed] on (date) at (time)."
"Note: If an employee is on extended leave, consideration will be given to delivering the notice via certified mail and U.S."
Postal mail.
Contact the assigned LERN specialist to determine when to start calculating the first day of the Advance Notice period.
(7) Employees usually remain in a duty status during the Advance Notice period unless they are a seasonal employee who is placed in non-duty status due to lack of work.
"Note: For occasions when an employee may be placed on conduct-related administrative leave during the Advance Notice period (for example, their continued workplace presence may pose a threat to themselves or others, result in loss of or damage to government property, or otherwise jeopardize legitimate government interests), see Interim Guidance Memorandum HCO-06-0223-0004, Interim Guidance on Conduct-Related Administrative Leave, dated April 24, 2023."
"(8) In compliance with the IRM 6.630 series and the National Agreement, for BU employees, employees may request and receive approval for leave during the Advance Notice period."
"(9) Management may rescind and reissue an Advance Notice if, for example, new information is discovered that may result in an additional charge (reason) or specification and/or a more severe penalty, a procedural error is found, or there is a change in the nexus."
"If the Advance Notice is rescinded, the Advance Notice period restarts."
"(10) If an employee chooses to resign or submit a retirement application during the Advance Notice period, management must not rescind the proposal letter since a resignation or retirement can be withdrawn or cancelled any time before the effective date."
"6.752.1.22 (12-13-2024)
Crime Provision (Exception to 30-day Advance Notice Period)
(1) 5 CFR 752 authorizes an exception to the 30-calendar day Advance Notice period if management has reasonable cause to believe the employee committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed."
"This exception is referred to as the ""crime provision."""
(2) The crime provision allows the IRS to shorten the Advance Notice period if management proposes an indefinite suspension or a removal.
The Advance Notice period for a crime provision action is seven calendar days.
This also applies to NBU employees.
"All other procedural aspects of an adverse action apply; however, the timeframe to submit a written reply is shortened to seven calendar days."
"See IRM 6.752.1.21, Advance Notice (Proposal Letter)."
BU employees can also refer to Article 39 of the National Agreement.
"Note: Crime provision letters are drafted by a LERN specialist and must be reviewed by the appropriate Area Counsel, GLS, prior to obtaining signatures."
"(3) Reasonable cause describes a situation where the information at hand (evidence, for example) supports management’s belief that the employee committed a crime for which imprisonment may be imposed."
"A police arrest is not sufficient evidence by itself to establish a reasonable cause; however, a grand jury indictment, arrest, or detainment by a magistrate may be relied on to support reasonable cause."
"(4) Proposing an indefinite suspension based on an indictment under the crime provision allows management to defer a decision until judicial proceedings are completed and/or sufficient evidence is available for a removal, or the employee is cleared of the allegation."
"(5) If the misconduct occurred off duty and/or off government premises, there must be a nexus between the crime the employee is believed to have committed and the efficiency of the service."
The nexus must be stated in the Advance Notice (proposal letter).
There are exceptions.
"For example, if the employee is charged with an egregious act of misconduct or crime, such as murder, nexus can be presumed."
"(6) If management proposes a removal under the crime provision and the employee or their representative asserts that a written and/or oral reply to the proposed action would prejudice their defense in the criminal action, management and/or the LERN specialist will consult with Area Counsel, GLS, before the Proposing Official decides if the proposed removal should be replaced with an indefinite suspension."
Refusing to reply based on a belief that a written/oral reply would prejudice the employee's defense will not delay the action.
"(7) If management does not want to propose and/or take a removal action until the criminal proceedings are adjudicated and/or more evidence is received to support removal, management can consider proposing an indefinite suspension."
An indefinite suspension allows the employee to quickly be taken off rolls while the matter is being adjudicated and/or investigated.
"Unlike a removal, an indefinite suspension is not based on provable misconduct; it is based on the IRS’s reasonable cause belief that the employee committed a crime for which the sentence of imprisonment may be imposed."
"(8) In addition to the other requirements in IRM 6.752.1.21, Advance Notice (Proposal Letter), a crime provision Advance Notice for an indefinite suspension must include the following statements:

What condition(s) will end the action (for example, completion of an investigation or adjudication of the criminal matter)

A removal action may be proposed prior to ending the indefinite suspension, and

The employee is immediately being placed in a non-duty status, with pay, if management believes continuing to work may pose a threat to themselves or others, result in loss of or damage to government property, or otherwise jeopardize legitimate government interests, as stated in Interim Guidance Memorandum HCO-06-0223-0004, Interim Guidance on Conduct-Related Administrative Leave, dated April 24, 2023."
"6.752.1.23 (12-13-2024)
Oral/Written Reply
(1) The purpose of an oral and/or written reply is to give an employee and/or their representative an opportunity to present information in response to the proposed action in the Advance Notice (proposal letter) before a decision is made."
"Information may include, but is not limited to, a defense to their alleged misconduct, denial of any reasons for the proposed action, mitigating factors, and/or a request for a less severe action."
"There is no requirement for the employee or their representative, if applicable, to request an oral reply or provide a written reply."
An employee may choose to make both a written and an oral reply.
"Oral Reply – If the employee requests to have an oral reply, they may attend or not attend the reply."
The employee may include affidavits or other evidence in support of the oral reply.
"Any written documents (including attachments, if provided) are reviewed and considered by the Deciding Official prior to making a decision and are made part of the case file."
"Written Reply – If the employee chooses to submit a written reply, there is no requirement that it be in an affidavit form or under oath."
The employee may include affidavits or other evidence in support of the written reply.
"Any written documents (including attachments, if provided) are reviewed and considered by the Deciding Official prior to making a decision and are made part of the case file."
"(2) An employee in active-duty status is given a reasonable amount of time, as stated in the Advance Notice (proposal letter), to prepare for (for example, review material relied on, secure affidavits, if desired, write a reply) and present oral and/or written replies."
"(3) The Oral Reply Officer is the Deciding Official who may redelegate that authority, in compliance with Delegation Order 6-29."
"Note: CI employees see IRM 1.2.2.7.18.1, Criminal Investigation Deviation from Servicewide Delegation Order 6-29, Authority to Address Employee Performance or Conduct Issues."
"(4) To prepare for the Oral Reply, the Oral Reply Officer (ORO) will:

Consult with their assigned LERN specialist

Review the proposal letter and supporting documentation (material relied on/evidence), and

Review the appropriate National Agreement provisions if the subject of the action is a BU employee."
"(5) During the Oral Reply, the ORO will:

Listen

Ask questions to clarify factual matters, if needed, and

Not discuss or argue the merits of the proposed action or proposal letter."
"(6) After the Oral Reply, the ORO will review the verbatim transcript of the oral reply and edit, if needed."
"Note: For BU employees, per Article 39 of the National Agreement, verbatim transcripts are required for a suspension of more than 14 days, an indefinite suspension, a reduction in grade/band or pay, and a furlough of 30 days or less."
This provision also applies to NBU employees.
"(7) Prior to reaching a final decision on the proposed action, if the ORO:

Is not the Deciding Official, they will give a copy of the verbatim transcript to the Deciding Official who will follow the steps in IRM 6.752.1.1.3.2, Management Responsibilities, paragraph (11)."
"Is the Deciding Official, they will follow the steps in IRM 6.752.1.1.3.2, Management Responsibilities, paragraph (11)."
"(8) If management receives a request(s) to postpone the oral reply or more time to submit a written reply, they will promptly provide it to their assigned LERN specialist who will assist management with responding."
"Absent reasonable requests for more time, time periods should be enforced to avoid prolonging the Advance Notice period."
"6.752.1.24 (12-13-2024)
Supplemental Notice
(1) A supplemental notice is issued to an employee if the Proposing Official and/or Deciding Official want to change the nexus statement or consider new or material information to support their proposal or decision, and the information was not stated in the proposal letter."
"(2) If a supplemental notice is issued to the employee, the employee may:

Request an oral reply within five workdays of receiving the supplemental notice, which must be held within ten workdays (absent mutual agreement), and/or

Submit a written reply within ten workdays of receiving the supplemental notice."
"(3) If the employee requests an oral reply, management will:

Prepare a written summary of the oral reply, and

Share a copy of the written summary with the employee and/or representative (if applicable) and give the employee/representative three workdays to review and make corrections."
"(4) In lieu of a supplemental notice, management has the option to rescind the original proposal letter and issue a new proposal letter, which restarts the Advance Notice period."
"6.752.1.25 (12-13-2024)
Decision Letter
(1) The decision letter for:

A suspension of 14 days or less may be issued after the 15-calendar day notice period."
"Suspensions of more than 14 days, removals, reductions in grade or pay, furlough of 30 days or less may be issued after the 30-calendar day notice period."
(2) The decision about an action proposed under 5 CFR 752 must be made by a higher management position than the Proposing Official.
"See Delegation Order 6-29, in IRM 1.2.2, Servicewide Delegations of Authority."
"For CI employees, see IRM 1.2.2.7.18.1, Criminal Investigation Deviation from Servicewide Delegation Order 6-29, Authority to Address Employee Performance or Conduct Issues."
"(3) No discussion or consideration of information or evidence other than what was included in the Advance Notice or those raised by the employee or their representative in an oral/written reply (if requested/submitted), may be considered when deciding."
"If the Deciding Official considers information/evidence not included in the Advance Notice or shared with the employee and/or representative, the action taken could be reversed."
"See IRM 6.752.1.24, Supplemental Notice."
"Note: In the event the employee submits a reply after the written reply deadline and before the end of the notice period, such reply should be given consideration, and the decision letter will include a statement that the late reply was received and considered."
"(4) Management must work with their assigned LERN specialist to ensure the contents of the decision letter follow law, rule, regulation, and the National Agreement, for BU employees."
"In compliance with 5 USC 7701 (c)(2), Appellate Procedures, the MSPB will reverse the action taken if the appellant shows:

Harmful error in the application of the IRS procedures in arriving at such decision

The decision was based on any prohibited personnel practice (see 5 USC 2303(b)), or

The decision was not per law."

They may not grieve the same matter and appeal it in another forum.
The filing of an appeal in both forums will result in the dismissal whichever action is filed later.
"6.752.1.31 (12-13-2024)
Settling a Corrective Action
(1) After management issues a corrective action (for example, the decision letter), the employee and/or their representative may choose to discuss the possibility of an informal resolution, which can be done before a grievance or an appeal is filed, or arbitration is invoked."
"The time limit to file a grievance, an appeal, or invoke arbitration is not extended while informal discussions occur."
"Note: If the employee or their representative and the IRS agree, in writing, to attempt to resolve the dispute through the EEO Alternative Dispute Resolution process, prior to filing an MSPB appeal, the time limit for filing an MSPB appeal is extended by 30 calendar days, for a total of 60 calendar days (5 CFR 1201.22)."
(2) Management must contact their assigned LERN specialist if they want to settle a disciplinary/adverse action by mitigating (reducing) the original penalty if it is not related to a Section 1203 violation.
Note: Only the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has the authority to mitigate Section 1203 violations.
"(3) After an appeal is filed or arbitration is invoked, third-party settlements are worked in collaboration with LERN management, and Area Counsel, GLS."
Management must contact their assigned LERN specialist for guidance.
Note: Only the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has the authority to mitigate Section 1203 violations.

"(2) If an employee fails to return to duty after a reasonable period (for example, 10 calendar days), management should ask the employee if they plan to continue their employment or if they are resigning."
"If they do not return to duty or resign or if they cannot be reached by telephone or letter, management can separate the employee from federal service without taking an adverse action."
"(3) If management becomes aware that an employee wants to return to work, it must not separate them based on abandonment of position."
"Note: The IRS does not normally use an abandonment-of-position action because, if the employee returns to duty and claims they did not abandon their position, OPM usually accepts their word, and the employee must be restored to duty."
"After the employee is restored to duty, management can begin the discipline or adverse action procedures for leave violations, if appropriate."
"6.752.1.33 (12-13-2024)
Employee Death
(1) The corrective action process ceases upon receipt of an employee’s proof of death, which may include an SF-50, Notification of Personnel Action."
"6.752.1.34 (12-13-2024)
Moratoriums on Addressing Misconduct Matters
(1) Types of moratoriums:

National Emergency - If the president declares a national emergency, such as the Coronavirus Disease pandemic, the IRS Human Capital Officer will determine if a moratorium on actions related to a misconduct is appropriate and announce the beginning and ending dates."
"Natural Disaster - If the president or other appropriate authority (for example, city or state official) declares a geographic area as a natural disaster, the business-based human resources staff (embedded) will collaborate with LERN and the Senior Commissioner’s Representative to determine if a moratorium is appropriate and announce the beginning and ending dates."
"Note: Natural disasters are defined as any natural catastrophe (for example, hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mud slide, snowstorm, or drought), or any fire, flood, or explosion, regardless of the cause, in any part of the United States, which the president or city/state official declares is causing damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance to help alleviate the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused by the disaster."
"Depending on the severity of the incident (for example, explosion, fire), this may include a terrorist attack."
"Winter Holiday Season - Annually for four weeks during the winter holidays, beginning two Mondays before December 25 and ending in January, two Fridays after December 25 (for example, December 16, 2024, through January 10, 2025)."
(2) What Occurs During a Moratorium - a moratorium does not prohibit all actions.
Management may continue with certain actions if appropriate.
"When a moratorium is in place, managers continue to work with a LERN specialist to begin addressing misconduct or continue addressing misconduct actions already in progress."
"During a moratorium, for employees not serving a probationary/trial period or a temporary/term appointment, managers will consider and decide whether the following activities should be held in abeyance or if they should continue."
"Signing/issuing an Advance Notice (proposal letter)

Signing/issuing a Final Decision (decision letter)

Interviewing/questioning an employee about misconduct

Issuing grievance replies/decisions

Holding grievance meetings

Conducting oral replies

If an employee began serving a suspension before the moratorium was effective, they continue serving the suspension until their return to duty date."
"6.752.1.35 (12-13-2024)
Correcting an Action
(1) Management may unilaterally correct mistakes made when taking a corrective action."
"(2) If management determines an action was taken erroneously, they may correct the error, even if an appeal, complaint, or grievance has been filed about the matter."
(3) Management must ensure they remove only the information they determine to be inaccurate or to reflect an action taken illegally or in error.
