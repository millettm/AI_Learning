add additional items necessary exhibit analyzing performance using traditional problemsolving model irs may use balanced performance measures corresponding underlying metrics identify understand changes performance identify improvement options
traditional problemsolving model approach irs used effectively several steps
receive data organizational units obtain data variety sources performance results quality review results data collected taxpayer advocate
instances organizational units may develop data locally
organizational units may often repeat step define problem
example initial scan data survey results may suggest problem exists customer service lead development initial problem statement
turn would require additional data collection accurately define problem
define problem cases problem may obvious
cases need analyze data identify problem
state problem objective terms
accurately worded problem statement important steps process
example taxpayers sufficient understanding irs procedures irs employees explaining procedures sufficiently taxpayers determine potential causes problem determining potential causes requires research
look data available
talk employees peers search potential causes
assess possible causes
dont jump conclusions solution
evaluate causes prioritize based upon effect problem
generate alternative solutions include involved parties generate alternatives
specify alternatives consistent organizational goals
specify short long term alternatives
brainstorm using others ideas
evaluate select alternative evaluate alternatives relative goals
evaluate proven possible outcomes
state selected alternative explicitly
implement follow solution plan implement pilot test chosen alternative
gather feedback affected parties
seek acceptance consensus affected
establish ongoing measures monitoring
evaluate longterm results based final solution
note cases solutions work need repeat step generate alternative solutions
alternatively consider reevaluating problem sometimes may find solution problem definition welldefined

training development quality assurance system tdqas ensure development quality training irs uses instructional design model guides process training assessment analysis design development implementation evaluation
model called training development quality assurance system tdqas
tdqas consists six phases related actions describe course development process assessment identify performance problems determine focus training development efforts
analysis describe trainee population inventory job tasks select tasks training analyze tasks conduct learning analysis
design design training plan construct test items prescribe course design strategy prescribe ojt design strategy prescribe job aid design strategy prescribe evaluation strategy
development develop draft materials try draft materials revise produce materials
implementation implement training tracking system prepare training program guidelines oversee training implementation
evaluation evaluate learner reaction achievement evaluate job performance organizational impact
time funding permit use recommended tdqas phases steps rather shortcut default procedures
tdqas model applies methods media training development delivery
tdqas model also applies contractor used develop course
tdqas used aid preparing specifications statement work sow
education community components must maintain documentation supporting outcomes used develop curricula learning content well master copies learning content
assessment actions associated assessment phase tdqas identify performance problem
discrepancy actual job performance desired job performance
performance problems may include inadequate performance experienced employees changed job responsibilities employees yet perform new technology affecting job performance newly selected employees lack necessary job skills
determine focus training development efforts
analysis actions associated analysis phase tdqas describe trainee population
trainee population description verifies revises assumptions concerning intended learner audience
comprehensive knowledge trainees instruction intended helps developers design training enable trainees learn effectively
addition demographic information useful establishing scope training programs trainee population data provide information concerning existing skills knowledge attitudes among trainees
training geared trainees build already know
preliminary training offered possess prerequisite knowledge skills
differences among trainees identified compensated training design
helps ensure trainees benefit instruction
failure identify existing trainee knowledge skills may lead unnecessary overtraining insufficient training
turn lead student boredom frustration even failure
trainee population data routinely referred throughout various phases tdqas
inventory job tasks
training development purposes crucial define job thoroughly also specify tasks components job
tasks represent possible targets upon training programs could focus
provides basis matchup job tasks requisite training programs lead successful job performance
failure produce accurate task inventory result voids training training wrong tasks
negatively affects job accomplishment
select tasks training
realworld conditions tasks associated particular occupation specialty need formally trained
partially due shortages resources time available training nature tasks factors
even resources available would prudent strategy considering retention career progression variables
desirable therefore provide economy training reducing number tasks necessary critical accomplishment job
task selection process tasks selected require formal training onthejob training performed using job aids
tasks require training eliminated
analyze tasks
task analysis training purposes process examining task selected training circumstances performed
provides information assist design development performanceoriented training
properly prepared task analysis save countless hours avoiding duplication effort among designers writers producers
even important common analysis base provides consistency continuity among various training products programs
analysis may also used identify common training among occupations opportunities generic modules merger training etc
goal ensure trainee trained conditions accurately reflect job performance result job proficiency
conduct learning analysis
last action analysis phase preliminary actual design training training support materials
based task analysis data specific training objectives written requisite knowledge skills determined job aids confirmed
special emphasis placed job aids may decrease need formal courses instruction
design actions associated design phase tdqas design training plan
training plan also viewed training strategy curriculum
training plan developed serves master plan training activities within occupation
specific training picture scheme occupation within function
overlapping redundant training objectives eliminated gaps training programs readily identified
training plan provides structure coordinated efficient training development activities streamlining integrating courses instruction provide right training right time right amount
construct test items
test items confused test instruments whether used formal testing scenario drill practice practical exercises form learning assessment measure whether trainee achieved training objective standard degree proficiency
derived analysis required successfully perform particular task job
prescribe course design strategy
course design strategy provides guidelines groupinstruction selfinstruction conducted classroom learning center job setting
strategy prepared extensive writing costly production begins
recipe blueprint learning prepared training developer writers production specialists ultimately follow
especially helpful using task forces outside contractors arrive clear understanding course developed
prescribe onthejob training ojt design strategy
provides link classroom training onthejob performance
ojt design strategy carefully planned ojt program organized around important jobrelated issues activities
ojt activities assignments logically optimally arranged facilitate learning process job setting
without ojt design strategy high probability mismatch objectives learning activities practice
followon training enhance expand upon learned classroom may inconsistent among trainees unless properly designed
prescribe job aid design strategy
job aids unless require training effective use usually faster develop less expensive easier revise
nevertheless must carefully planned
terms improving job performance job aids decrease amount time required complete task reduce number errors increase confidence employee ability job eliminating unnecessary memorization
prescribe evaluation strategy
primary purpose evaluation training context gather credible data improving training turn lead improved job performance
planning evaluation wait last minute
commitment sle involved parties evaluation process obtained advance
minimizes chances evaluation perceived threatening
resources necessary evaluation identified early facilitate whole process
development actions associated development phase tdqas develop draft materials
development logical followon assessment analysis design activities
draft materials provide opportunity multiple sources input training program materials well serve checks balances mechanism minimizing errors
try draft materials appropriate
tests whether training materials teach
tryout draft materials bypassed
process contributes significantly toward successful training programs ultimately job performance
studies shown even limited number tryout participants identify errors shortcomings materials
revise produce materials
logical conclusion development phase
training training support materials effective efficient educationally sound ready distribution
implementation actions associated implementation phase tdqas implement training tracking system
action link produced materials implementation
concerns administration logistics cataloging warehousing distributing training training support materials
addition mechanisms tracking trainees training evaluation purposes subsequent conduct instruction addressed
training tracking system enters training training support materials system actual implementation training programs occur
enter course information enterprise learning management system httpselmswebirsgov accordance elms procedures
oversee training implementation
purpose enable trainers teach set classroom either virtual facetoface obtain training materials prepare conduct training assemble trainees conduct training initiate evaluation process
training implementation shared responsibility leads centralized delivery services cds embedded learning education
evaluation actions associated evaluation phase tdqas evaluate learner reaction achievement
learner reaction determines people feel training
learner reaction also known level feedback answers question like
lowest level comprehensive approach evaluation never stop
learner achievement known level feedback
continuation process learner achievement determines whether trainees learned skills acquired knowledge result training
participants learn supposed learn
two aspects evaluation process provide basis deciding whether training met planned objectives
helps remove guesswork training programs obtaining hard data upon base revision efforts
evaluate job performance organizational achievement
evaluating job performance known level feedback
training context evaluation job performance determines whether trainees used knowledge skills taught job
differently result training
evaluation organizational impact known level feedback
also training context evaluation organizational impact determines whether organizational outcomes influencedaccomplished training program
training program impact mission organization
two final aspects evaluation help enhance job proficiency removing guesswork training program hard data used basis revision efforts
failure determine training impact job performance allows training deficiencies remain undetected
evaluating link training programs subsequent job performance establishes accountability training organizational mission

great employees deserve great managers believe employees leave organization strong possibility leaving poor leadership
manager worked human resources hr longer year heard similar stories exit interviews
based exit interviews hr professionals acquire pretty strong gutlevel feeling managers organization build relationships people willingly follow managers organization responsible employees willing share talents competitors
important note employees leave organization examples bad turnover
strongly believe concept good turnover
poorperforming employees happy anyone anything associated organization
employees jobs stir environment everyone else suffers

bad turnover occurs employees outstanding contributors companys success willingly leave organization equal even less opportunity another organizationjust escape boss intolerable working conditions

yet one leader makes difference
chapter shared actions separate highest lowestranked leaders employee opinion surveys
although steps simple many managers experience difficulty following consistent basis
years working organizations coaching managers identified eleven stupid things managers mess organizations departments teams
managers could pick one even stupid behaviors say wow done difference managers managers disengage employees destroy workplace excellence comes one word frequency
although managers honest admit occasionally slipped done something stupid careers managers incite havoc workplace put least one stupid things play high level frequency
worse yet many managers know causing conflict whatever reason dont stop
cases negative behavior pointed even escalate instances poor performancejust
stupid behavior inability control emotions utilized appropriately emotions wonderful human attribute
used improperly managers emotions devastate organizations employees
number one list stupid behaviors inability control emotions
worst offenders managers labeled moody recently hope giving manager feedback would enable even effective conducted interviews employees peers
respondents stated persons primary opportunity improvement display emotions consistent appropriate situation
examples respondents shared regarding inappropriate leadership behaviors included raising voice angry whether meetings oneonone communications sending emails accusatory content using foul language mad
respondents stated either good list list ignored
one employee shared one time missed deadline report
apologized manager deadline slipping cracks manager replied anger sorry good enough
never accept apology incompetence finally wasnt enough negative feedback win someone label moody respondents went add manager came work morning greet speak anyone
well known around office morning person
interview process really grateful one respondent said hope planning give feedback late afternoon
never good accepting feedback
morning downright nasty interview managers reputations moody angry almost describe inappropriate behaviors honest passionate communication one manager recently told us really honest person
tell people think right moment think people handle honest communication excuse allows manager absolve responsibility employee accepting communicatesthe problem employee manager
reality impact type stupid behavior words spoken written permanent
challenge pervious example managers communication perceived angry inappropriate meanspirited
yet asked manager goal hurt people undermine employees levels commitment motivation great job manager would respond resounding course interesting note managers work described angry moody well aware emotions affecting personal professional lives
someone ton guts told managers responses situations wrong undermine morale
however managers continue use behaviors workplace
challenge labeled moody angry displaying emotions fit situation people unsure approach person fear respond
people walk around halls asking today today good day considered moody emotional person one toughest labels shed change minds employees peers
stupid behavior making impulsive decisions emotional managers tend reactive known making impulsive decisions
managers accumulate track record making quick decisions undermine organizations success
managers guilty shooting without first taking aim fond screaming fire fire fire sound alarm stand back watch troops rally put blaze
recently worked impulsive vice president vp facilities strong dislike smell burned popcorn
decisive leader banned microwave popcorn throughout facility
despite policy twice previous month detected offending odor
wanting solve major crisis vp dedicated efforts entire facilities team researching purchasing installing video surveillance cameras break rooms
efforts didnt stop
assigned team members rotating basis review surveillance tapes
last heard popcorn burner identified search continues
typically fire put workforce resumes working organizational priorities
people feel good accomplishments doesnt take long impulsive manager stumble upon another crisis sound alarm
unanimous entire team drops rallies put yet another fire
enlightened team members view crisis day preventable major disruption work overall organizational objectives
worked company ceo personal dislike head important project impacted entire organization
known impulsive decisions ceo determined person fired day
asked ceo plan project manager fired looked us said dont plan asked know could find someone qualified emotional impulsive managers share common characteristic
although known decisiveness also known selfcentered crisismanagement leadership style
seldom consider overall organizational departmental priorities hold little regard importance someone elses work
stupid behavior blaming others number three list behaviors get managers big trouble taking initiative proactively solve problems produce results lead organizations success
managers famous blaming lack results departments direct reports bosses even customers
exception rule things go right managers almost always first accept credit praise
managers famous focusing energy answering two questions wrong blame managers reach whole new level address third question psychologically whack punish psychological whacks occur manager talks wrong person another department situation
talking always occurs behind backs managers never guts address issue directly individual
served executive coaches two highlevel highly compensated managers refused cooperate one spoke negatively rivals department team members consistently gossiped pointed fingers difficulties
fact sometimes seemed manager spending full day strategically plotting demise
ultimately despite coaching fair amount warning individuals lost jobs due inability look solutions conflict
years working executives difficulty maintaining effective workplace relationships blaming others inadequacies often found dug deep methods operation discovered lacked confidence ability get job done
lack confidence ability influence environment take necessary actions produce positive results one way compensate look others blame inadequacies
stupid behavior thinking managers sound like warming opera sing praises managers love tell amazing prior accomplishments organizations worked past wonderful
relating great achievements indirectly put people current organization order build
way things done past often opportunity speak derogatorily everyone else
interviewed manager adamant one person company knowledge skills accomplish companys goals
stunned comment asked manager sure understood correctly one person either knowledge skills manager boldly responded one organization big picture one thing lead change take organization even higher level
highestranked leaders benchmarks define clear compelling vision clarify performance expectations communicate goals staff
another thing however attempt motivate people change telling badly handled things past
approach nothing cause animosity resentment toward manager
interview collect feedback manager one employee pointed successful enough hire new manager move family way across country
join organization first month listen tell everyone bad good turns people
consultants manager hit friendly fire managers take credit departments divisions organizations success show second form taking credit find difficult praise recognize give credit people actually work led success
one managers coached confidently said boss idea
wasnt company would wasted thousands dollars buying needless equipment dont know equipment executive coached employees caught revolving door
none stayed length time last way alleged egotistical arrogant
stupid behavior negativity although rare time time conduct employee opinion surveys find opinions management team negative opinions employees
uncover issue statement organization exciting future second statement helps uncover employees feelings regarding future organization offers type job want three years situations employees opinions higher management team feel like telling managers turn control company employees even positive view organizations future managers
reason compelling positive vision future foundation bestofthebest organizations
negative visions come low aspirations
managers dont think situation improved vision raise levels aspirations set goals improve situation
poor visions mediocre goals lead workforce low morale
manager negative vision combined low aspirations improvement greatest gift give organization quit
stupid behavior failing communicate paul newman starred great movie cool hand luke
classic luke sent prison camp cutting heads parking meters
asked would thing explanation gives small town much eve nin greatest quote comes later movie strother martin tells paul newman failure communicate insightful statement applicable managers dont appropriately communicate turn singlehandedly undermine workplace excellence
several categories communication blunders including communication timely direct honest
recently analyzing organizations employee opinion survey data large discrepancies response statement managers supervisors company seek opinions thoughts employees work outsiders viewing culture employees perspective clear us managers asked employees ideas opinions whereas others didnt
also noted general responses statements communication favorable within department scores throughout whole survey likewise higher
words people asked insights felt input valued tended positive relationship employer
gained insight companys organizational climate regarding employee input innovation one senior level manager said ask doesnt necessarily mean take action input
understand weve business long time know works doesnt surefire recipe failure assume know employees dont need know anything jobs
tell employees think need hear sit back try fun negative surprises start rising level
referred mushroom theory management
managers believe keep employees dark feed load manure like mushrooms fine
managers busy timely communication
active keeping balls air feel time communicate necessary information would keep customers happy employees successful
feel everything faster delegate
haste cover one mess create another lack communication
people organization continually surprised find things last minute fact positively impact outcome
another example stupid behavior failure provide direct honest feedback
managers go around telling everyone thinking except person actually could something information
interviews love ask question told employees boss peers strong concerns way project progressing uncommon manager struggling organization look us eye hesitantly say push managers direct communication hear following excuses feel feedback would appreciated outside scope authority give honest feedback favorite hoping would figure change without needing say anything managers actually lie providing information directly asked question
almost impossible build relationship people willingly follow perceived untrustworthy
worked organization employee meeting one person asked ceo going layoff
ceo working diligently senior management executing layoff end month looked employees said plans layoff lie
hard tell employees jobs may jeopardized layoff honest thing say would difficult talk something devastating layoff need know layoff real possibility
commitment communicate information soon specific numbers concrete plan take care people laid fascinating people consistently speak truth want really emphasize point insert phrase going honest sometimes even ask honest frank every time hear words feel like saying glad going make conversation special honest
mean havent honest stupid behavior talking first listening later old saying god gave us two ears one mouth intended us use given proportion applicable
managers undermine workplace excellence tendency talk first listen latera lot laterand sometimes
listening asking questions gain even information like walking doctors office saying doctor really hurt need help doctor responds doctor years one best helping people get better
prescription
take four pills day days
end days feel better
questions patient brains would thinking dont want know hurt long hurting done try make hurt go away one summer peter went pharmacy buy painrelief medication youngest daughter stung bee
years old wasnt confident buy went pharmacist held benadryl said daughter stung bee
would good thing daughter take without thought pharmacist replied yeah work walked away shaking head thinking didnt even ask questions like old daughter
allergic bees
long ago stung
much swelling
stung
opinion pharmacist committed form malpractice
reality many managers commit leadership malpractice daily basis react without thinking say something later regret
instead opening mouths moving closer goals open mouths say something moves farther away goals
asking questions listening
reasons managers listen well
first feel need know new additional information new information help better managers
second managers actively listen believe already know answers
third managers listen feel strong need control conversation talking
three reasons powerful enough many managers lose desire great listeners
without desire listen impact managers colleagues almost always given choice people would prefer work manager
stupid behavior yearning acceptance one behaviors gets managers huge trouble working hard friends coworkers things think others organization like
recently asked supervisor coached employee coming work late meeting standards job
supervisor responded
talked performance good friends dumbfounded
kind true friend would exhibit behaviors like chronic tardiness poor performance would undermine supervisorsfriends ability successful role
undermining supervisorsfriends success work twisted characteristic friendship
recognizing rewarding excellent performance key practice organizations bestofthebest benchmark
managers let real perceived friendship get way identifying performance problems affect entire team likely achieve organizations vision
likely demoralize productive workers lose
another organization supervisor told us give people honest feedback really cared direct reports wanted like supervisor
supervisors tell us honest people enormous need liked reminded story old man young boy donkey
old man young boy walking donkey highway
car stopped driver told old man crazy
young boy walking riding perfectly healthy donkey old man attempt make driver happy put boy donkey started walking
little farther road another car pulled man said old man crazy
young boy perfectly healthy
old man
riding donkey attempt please person old man took boy donkey climbed started walking
walking minutes another car slowed driver stated old man donkey perfectly capable carrying
riding donkey pleasing old man lifted young boy aboard went street riding donkey
next donkey walked creek would step foot water
another passerby stopped told old man needed get pull donkey creek
donkey would budge
someone else stopped told old man boy needed tug donkey
passerby even described donkey stubborn teenager
still yet another person told old man boy needed pull old man needed push donkey water
lastly one sage owner many donkeys told old man old man boy needed get behind donkey push might water donkey would grudgingly walk side
took latest advice please sage pushed hard donkey stumbled creek broke neck drowned
moral story applies leadership try please everyone going lose ass
stupid behavior exhibiting poor judgment thinking favorite question ask managers coaching accused exercising incredibly poor judgment
constitutes poor judgment
examples
managers show poor judgment talk negatively one employee front another em ployee
managers think con fiding one employee indirectly building even stronger relationship employee speaking
reality time manager speaks poorly one employee another employee per son walks away thinking talks nasty others behind backs say present speak negatively boss organization
talk biting hand feeds
manager confides others stupid boss listeners thinking boss must stupid hiring someone loyal talks behind peoples backs
experience people talk negatively boss organization eventually asked leave boss
believe direct reports desire become person ally involved relationship act desires
first admit many personal lationships began working environment
unfortunately problem becoming emotionally involved sub ordinate creates tremendous liabilities man ager employee organization
use foul language say inappropriate things others
although many us may guilty slipping occasionally important recognize foul language work business environment
stupid behavior selective hearing defensive managers tend surround yes men women
appreciate feedback support believe
managers value truth
may spond emotional outburst anger tell communicant message wrong start silent treatment exclude team member managers selected group people allowed give feedback
outcome defensive managers produce environment good grasp reality make decisions without available information
vicious cy cle starts people feel comfortable sharing important information know manager wont agree information needs conveyed
instance interview phase executive coaching project getting consistent theme employees
variety different ways employees telling us boss rude
asked examples heard things like cuts youre speaking hangs walks right sees doesnt even say hello asks question turns around leaves finished talk ing one bold employee even said weve tried talking
doesnt want know
seems like enough people tell tail ought turn around take look loved employees advice
managers exhibit stupid behavior dont want know reality dont want confused another point view
stupid behavior trusting people amazing many managers hire good people dont trust get job done
managers trust people dont like delegate feel need personally complete anything importance
belief becomes selffulfilling prophecy
trust people delegate
delegate develop team members skills handle even greater responsibility
people gain experience delegate confirm initial belief trusted
whether believe trust people right
employees believe boss trusts go way demonstrate discretionary effort ensures undermine expectations trust boss
managers believe trust people hence delegate also right
employees necessary skills fulfill managers expectations
second problem emerges managers trust team members
take long staff trust manager
happens people think good trustworthy person
deserve communicated delegated assume even greater responsibility manager direct reports start believe trust manager
direct reports start withhold information lack oftrust cycle begins grow
also umbrella trusting people desperate need control everything
managers total control comfortable
worry someone else job perfect either able fix problem reflect negatively
maintain high degree control managers communicate necessary information timely manner
delegate tasks build capacity people organization
schedule vacations without controlling everything fall apart worse everyone figure control freak needed
frequency name game managers exhibit stupid behaviors
reading chapter theres good chance nodded maybe laughed recognition
longer career likely encountered types behaviors
difference poor managers choose follow one behaviors frequently cases extreme degree
even peers staff executive coach ask questions provide feedback improve leadership skills change behaviors
losing game
managers willing learn practice new approaches

understand appreciate treated fairly recognize fair mean equal
bestof thebest organizations recognize value employees provide innovation tirelessly work solve problems value employees jobs
reasons bestofthebest go way differentiate rewards given top performers
holding ev eryone accountable clearly communicated performance standards helps eliminate feeling favoritism
questions employee opinion survey compared two bench marks question regarding favoritism widest spread bestofthebest exceeding overall benchmark per centage points
recently ceo told us policy publicly recognizing employees successful results felt served upset employees received recognition
duhit supposed
ceo right employees might upset maybe stirring little uneasiness rest workforce bad thing
fair go recognizing rewarding top performers maybe people say hey also capable producing extraordinary results might motivated raise contributions even higher level
interview employees organizations policies procedures pay systems fair high performers ask go way work hours day given raise someone comes work late day struggles contribute two hours real work excellent question
clearly communicating performance standards holding people accountable helps build environment fair absent favoritism
recognizing rewarding best performers sends message system fair equal
data demonstrate bestofthebest firmly root concept cultures
exceed organizations overall benchmark percentage points response statement company treated fairly priceless outcome trust management andor owners employees trust manager management team

presence trust outcome well organization successfully implements keys workplace excellence
data tell us lack trust managers especially senior managers strongly influences organizations ability establish workplace excellence

people like say enough money least allow hate job
dont believe
interviewed many extremely wellpaid people hate jobs would rather anything else

data show response statement people company enjoy bestofthe best organizations exceed overall benchmark percentage points
priceless outcome retention companies fail create workplace excellence employees engaged best employees leave first
depart ones greatest number viable options
everyone ever worked finest employees given option would likely follow next organization
retention top employees becomes major issue organization fails establish great working environment
bigger retention problem involves marginal poor performers happy stay
remain organization lifetime options
anyone leaves organization plan take marginal performers along
unless plan change marginal poor performers behaviors share competitor people life
seen bestofthebest much better job main taining high performance standards organizations
marginal employees usually last long
poor marginal employees best serve bestofthebest organizations working competitor
responding statement company offers chance kind job want three years best ofthebest employees ratings exceeded ratings employees overall benchmark percentage points
