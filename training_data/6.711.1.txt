6.711.1.2 (08-27-2025)
Labor Relations Authorities
The Federal Labor Relations Authority (Authority or FLRA), also known as the Federal Service Labor Management Relations statute, is codified in 5 USC 71. The FLRA is an independent administrative federal agency that administers the LMR program for non-postal federal employees. The FLRA is composed of the Authority, the Office of General Counsel, and the Federal Services Impasses Panel.
The Authority has three full-time members appointed by the President of the United States. They adjudicate ULP disputes, applications for review of decisions and orders issued in representation matters, exceptions to grievance arbitration awards, and negotiability disputes that arise during collective bargaining. The Authority also provides statutory training to assist federal agencies and unions in understanding their rights and responsibilities under 5 USC 71.
The Office of General Counsel promotes effective LMR by investigating Unfair Labor Practice allegations and prosecuting them when warranted, conducting elections and determining representational matters, issuing guidance, providing training to federal managers and unions, and providing alternative dispute resolution services.
The Federal Service Impasses Panel (FSIP or Panel) resolves impasses between federal agencies and unions representing federal employees arising under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (5 USC 71) and the Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act (5 USC 61). If bargaining followed by mediation assistance does not result in a voluntary agreement, either party (management or NTEU) or the parties jointly may request the Panel's assistance. If the Panel has jurisdiction, it has the authority to recommend and/or direct the use of various dispute-resolution procedures. If the parties are unable to reach a voluntary settlement after using the dispute-resolution procedures, the Panel may take whatever action it deems necessary, including the imposition of contract terms, to resolve the dispute. The parties may not appeal the merits of the Panel's decision to any court.
.
6.711.1.3 (08-27-2025)
Exclusive Union Representation
NTEU may represent or act on behalf of BU employees in:
Negotiations with management regarding COE
Formal discussions conducted by management concerning grievances, personnel policies or practices, or other conditions of employment, and
Conduct investigations if the employee reasonably believes the interview may result in discipline and the employee requests NTEU representation.
6.711.1.4 (08-27-2025)
Managing Changes to BU Conditions of Employment
Managers are responsible for communicating and consulting with their colleagues about potential changes in BU COE. Sharing potential changes with other members of management is fundamental to effective communications. Prompt and effective communications results in managers learning about potential BU COE changes through management channels rather than from NTEU or other sources.
Before a change to BU COE can be negotiated, if required, or implemented, management must read IRM 1.11.2.5.1.4, IRM Changes Affecting Conditions of Employment of Bargaining Unit Employees, and IRM 1.11.9.4.4, Labor/Employee Relations & Negotiations, and follow the procedures to contact LERN.
When analyzing a potential change to BU COE consider, for example:
The impact on BU employees
CBA requirements (e.g., the NA)
Management’s rights in the labor-management relationship
Management’s interests and responsibilities, and
The legal responsibility to NTEU.
Note: See Article 47, Mid-Term Bargaining, of the 2022 National Agreement, for procedures and time limits for notice and bargaining.
All bargaining between the parties is national in scope except for Reassignments/Realignments and Voluntary Relocations (see Article 15, Reassignments/Realignments and Voluntary Relocations, of the 2022 National Agreement). LRSN provides notice to NTEU prior to implementing any change that has more than a de minimis impact (i.e., the BU COE matter is substantively negotiable) on personnel policies, practices, or other matters affecting the working conditions of BU employees.
NTEU and management must negotiate in good faith to reach agreement. If an agreement is reached, a written agreement is prepared. If no agreement is reached and the parties are at impasse, management may not implement the change for BU employees until third-party options are attempted (e.g., requesting FMCS assistance and filing a request with FSIP). If management implements a BU COE change before third-party options are resolved, NTEU may file a ULP. HCO and the impacted business unit(s) senior leadership will determine whether to implement the change for only NBU employees while negotiations are conducted for BU employees.
Note: In rare circumstances, if an extraordinary and exigent need to implement a change to BU COE arises prior to completing negotiations, management must discuss this situation with LRSN before implementing the change.
6.711.1.5 (08-27-2025)
ULP Charges and Complaints
See 5 USC 7116 for a list of the actions considered to be a ULP.
ULPs may be filed with the FLRA by any individual, NTEU or the IRS.
The FLRA and Administrative Law Judges have authority to remedy ULP findings. Remedies include orders to the charged party to cease and desist from the ULP, which usually requires the charged party to post a notice promising not to violate the law. The Authority can also order more stringent remedies, such as rescinding the action at issue.
6.711.1.5.1 (08-27-2025)
ULP Reporting
Managers who receive a ULP must send it to LRSN at HCO Arbitrations. LRSN will coordinate the handling of the ULP with GLS.
Managers must not speak with or respond to NTEU or the FLRA about the ULP. Any attempts by NTEU to contact or speak with management should be directed to the assigned GLS attorney. If unknown, management should direct those communications to LRSN.
LRSN works with the assigned GLS attorney and management to ensure compliance with 5 CFR 2423.
6.711.1.5.2 (08-27-2025)
IRS Investigation of a ULP Charge
LRSN manages the case for each ULP charge and GLS provides a final response to any allegation(s) with LRSN’s concurrence.
Management must respond to inquiries and disclose all relevant facts to LRSN and GLS, as appropriate.
6.711.1.5.3 (08-27-2025)
FLRA Investigation of a ULP Charge
The FLRA investigator will work with the assigned GLS attorney to schedule interviews with managers and/or employees, as appropriate.
If the FLRA invites an employee(s) to participate in a proceeding (e.g., giving a statement to the FLRA investigator), the employee should be granted administrative time to attend. Absent a severe work interruption, management will approve the employee meeting with the FLRA investigator during the employee’s regular work hours.
Travel expenses will be reimbursed per Article 29, Travel, of the 2022 National Agreement and applicable travel regulations in IRM 1.32.1, IRS Local Travel Guide, and IRM 1.32.11, IRS City-to-City Travel Guide.
For information on an NTEU representative’s time, see IRM 6.711.1.1, Official or Bank Time for NTEU Representatives.
6.711.1.5.4 (08-27-2025)
ULP Settlements
FLRA encourages voluntary settlements between the parties and prefers not to reverse or interfere with such arrangements.
All stakeholders are included in settlement discussions.
Before initiating settlement discussions with NTEU or FLRA, the assigned LERN specialist and GLS attorney will consult with the appropriate management level(s) to identify, for example, management’s interests and settlement options.
LRSN must approve the proposed settlement agreement if it affects the national labor management practices, policies, and procedures. LRSN may need to secure Agency Head Review approval
The proposed settlement must not be discussed with parties, who don’t have a need to know, such as a local union official or employee.
6.711.1.6 (08-27-2025)
Employee Grievances
For BU employees, see Article 41, Employee Grievance and Local Institutional Grievances, of the 2025 Addendum to the 2022 National Agreement, for details.
For NBU employees, see IRM 6.771.1, Grieving Matters of Personal Concern, for details.
Note: IRM 6.771.1 also provides the policy for BU employees for matters that are not covered in the 2022 National Agreement and the 2025 Addendum to the National Agreement.
6.711.1.7 (08-27-2025)
Local and National Institutional Grievances
See Article 41, Employee Grievance and Local Institutional Grievances, of the 2025 Addendum to the 2022 National Agreement, and Article 42, National Institutional Grievance Procedures, of the 2022 National Agreement for details.
6.711.1.8 (08-27-2025)
Information Requests
See Article 8, Union Rights, Section 9, of the 2022 National Agreement, for details.
LERN processes information requests made under 5 USC 7114(b)(4).
The authority to disclose tax returns and/or tax return information is covered in 26 USC 6103.
6.711.1.8.1 (08-27-2025)
Submitting an Information Request
Per Article 8, Union Rights, of the 2022 National Agreement, all information requested by NTEU under 5 USC 7114(b)(4) must be submitted to the Info Request Mailbox. If the request is not submitted to the mailbox, there is no obligation to respond.
NTEU must articulate a particularized need for the requested information (i.e., why they need the information, how they plan to use it, and how use of the information relates to their representational responsibilities under the statute). A generic statement that the information is needed to perform NTEU’s representational responsibilities does not establish a particularized need.
6.711.1.8.2 (08-27-2025)
Responding to Information Requests
See Article 8, Union Rights, of the 2022 National Agreement, for time limits to provide information or seek clarification.
After LERN consults with management, if needed, LERN determines what information can be released to NTEU, coordinates the release of information, and prepares the response to NTEU.
6.711.1.8.3 (08-27-2025)
Communications
The FLRA expects the IRS and NTEU to communicate about the information requested and the release of information (e.g., if clarification is requested, the party should respond).
6.711.1.9 (08-27-2025)
Material Relied On Requests
Requests for material relied on (MRO) are not information requests under 5 USC 7114(b)(4). MROs may be requested as described in the employee’s advance notice (i.e., a proposal letter for a conduct or performance issue). See IRM 6.752.1.21, Advance Notice, or IRM 6.432.1.10, Advance Notice (Proposal Letter) Based on Unacceptable Performance.
Managers who receive a request for MRO must promptly send it to their LERN specialist.
The assigned LERN specialist will review and respond to the request for MRO.
6.711.1.10 (08-27-2025)
Union Dues
See Article 10, Dues Withholding, of the 2022 National Agreement, for details.
Separate authority may exist apart from 5 USC 7115 to honor membership dues assignments from individuals who are not included within a bargaining unit although such authority would not apply in the case of assignments payable to labor organizations, such as NTEU which represent bargaining unit employees.
Certain supervisors, for example, may qualify for dues assignments under a savings provision found at 5 CFR 550.322. In cases such as these, any agreements between the IRS and NTEU are inapplicable, and the assignment will be handled in accordance with any other requirements that may apply.
6.711.1.11 (08-27-2025)
Official or Bank Time for NTEU Representatives
See Article 9, Stewards and Official Time, of the 2025 Addendum to the 2022 National Agreement, for details.
To request help with official or bank time, see IRM 6.711.1.1.3, Responsibilities, for contact information.
6.711.1.12 (08-27-2025)
Reporting Job Actions
Information about potential, threatened, or existing job actions by IRS employees against the IRS or federal government must be communicated to LERN. See IRM 6.711.1.1.3, Responsibilities, for contact information.
Note: Examples of job actions include but are not limited to employee demonstrations, picketing, actual work stoppages or work disruptions, group refusal to work overtime or to perform assigned duties, and slowdowns or sick-outs.
