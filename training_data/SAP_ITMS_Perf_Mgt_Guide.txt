1	Performance & Goal Management in SAP SuccessFactors


The detailed procedure for testing the scope item Performance & Goal Management in SAP SuccessFactors
after solution activation is described in the following. Each process step is covered in its own section.
This document describes the process of performing Goal Management, Continuous Performance Management, Performance Management with Calibration, and 360 Degree Reviews.
Goal Management enables employees and managers to align individual goals with company business goals and helps organizations ensure that all employees are aligned and working on the right things.

Continuous Performance Management involves an ongoing dialogue between the employee and manager. It includes regular check-ins to ensure employees are working on the right things in the right way. The
Continuous Performance Management process follows these steps to enable employees to get quick feedback on their work through frequent and structured conversations with their manager. As a manager, it helps you track your team members' progress effortlessly and offers you a simple way to provide coaching advice.

Performance Management involves an ongoing dialogue between the employee and manager. It includes establishing clear performance expectations to support business objectives and providing regular feedback and coaching. The Performance Management process follows these steps to evaluate an employee’s performance and identify future performance expectations.

360 Degree Reviews helps organizations collect feedback on employees’ performance and behavior from everyone, both inside and outside of an organization. Quantitative and qualitative data from 360 Developmental Surveys & Multi-Rater Assessments can be collected and graphically displayed by various
categories. Leverage 360 degree reviews to help increase accuracy and effectiveness in providing feedback.
