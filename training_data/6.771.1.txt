(2) Agency grievances on ratings of record are no longer permitted for non-bargaining unit employees in compliance with Executive Order 14171, Restoring Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce, dated January 20, 2025, which reinstated Executive Order 13839, Promoting Accountability and Streamlining Removal Procedures Consistent with Merit System Principles, dated May 25, 2018.

(10) IRM 6.771.1.1.6, Terms/Acronyms, revised title to comply with IRM 1.11.2.2.4, Address Management and Internal Controls; revised the definitions for Factfinder, Factfinding, Factual Dispute, Grievance Deciding Official; added definition for Bargaining Unit Employee, National Treasury Employees Union and Personal Concern; replaced definition for Days with Calendar Days, deleted Executive Misconduct Unit, Grievance Examiner, and Senior Executive Services, which do not need to be defined in this IRM.

(11) IRM 6.771.1.1.7, Related Resources, deleted 5 CFR 771, Agency Administrative Grievance System, and Department of Treasury Transmittal Number 68, Administrative Grievance System. 5 CFR 771 , Agency Administrative Grievance System, is appropriately covered in IRM 6.771.1.2, Authorities, and 5 CFR 315, Career and Career-Conditional Employment, takes precedence over Department of Treasury Transmittal Number 68, Administrative Grievance System; added Document 11678, IRS and NTEU National Agreement, and Document 12829, The General Records Schedules.

(12) IRM 6.771.1.2, Policy, deleted Deputy Commissioner for Operations Support and Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement, which were replaced with the Deputy Commissioner in April 2024.

(17) IRM 6.771.1.7, Grievance Coverage, moved from former IRM 6.771.1.6; moved “Failure to receive a non-competitive promotion” to a separate line.

(18) IRM 6.771.1.7.1, Appealable Decisions Excluded from Agency Grievances, revised title; listed in order of regulations; moved from former IRM 6.771.1.6.1.

(19) IRM 6.771.1.8, Grievance – Step 1, moved from former IRM 6.771.1.7; corrected timeframes; Form 5877 is now filed with the second-level manager instead of the first-level manager; added the following: the second-level manager has seven calendar days to determine the appropriate Grievance Deciding Official, the Step 1 Grievance Deciding Official can be outside the grievant’s management chain, the Step 1 Grievance Deciding Official’s responsibilities, including what is required in the Step 1 decision, and the appeal of the Step 1 decision, which was moved from former IRM 6.771.1.8, Grievance - Step 2.

(20) IRM 6.771.1.9, Grievance – Step 2, moved from former IRM 6.771.1.8; deleted non-payband performance grievances, which are no longer permitted (see number 2 above); disciplinary action grievances and appeals of Step 1 decisions are now filed with the third-level manager; the Step 2 decision is final and can no longer be appealed.

(21) IRM 6.771.1.10, Threshold Information, revised title and moved content from former IRM 6.771.1.7.1, Threshold Issues. Created this new subsection after IRM 6.771.1.8, Grievance - Step 1, and IRM 6.771.1.9, Grievance - Step 2, since threshold issues can apply at Step 1 or 2 of the grievance process.

(22) IRM 6.771.1.10.1, Threshold Denials, moved content from former IRM 6.771.1.7.2, Threshold Denials.

(25) Deleted former IRM 6.771.1.11, Grievance – Step 3, Final Appeal, because the grievance process was changed from a three-step to a two-step process.

(26) IRM 6.771.1.12, Cancellation or Rejection of a Grievance, replaced “LERN Associate Director, Field Operations” with “LERN Field Operations Deputy Director.”

(27) Added IRM 6.771.1.13, Records Retention.

(28) Deleted IRM Exhibit 6.771.1-1, Agency Grievance System Grievance Deciding Official Request for Factfinder, which is an operational form kept by the Labor/Employee Relations and Negotiations Division.

Policy
It is IRS policy to support an environment in which employees or grievants may express concern(s) informally or use this IRM to seek a formal resolution.
Employees may file grievances without fear of restraint, interference, coercion or discrimination. Grievances are to be fairly and objectively considered and processed timely.
Most grievances are addressed within the business unit’s management chain. On occasion, grievances may be addressed outside the grievant’s management chain (e.g., if the remedy cannot be granted by the grievant’s management chain).
A grievance will not be elevated to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) or the Deputy Commissioner unless the grievant reports directly to them.
If an executive (i.e., Senior Executive Service (SES), Administratively Determined and Streamlined Critical Pay), the head of the business unit, Deputy Commissioner or Commissioner is the GDO, there is only one grievance step.
Management may grant up to four hours of administrative time to grievants and authorized representatives to discuss, prepare and present the grievance. No more than four hours of administrative time is allowed regardless of the number of steps the grievance involves.
Note: Grievants (and authorized representatives (if applicable)) must request and receive approval for administrative time in advance.
6.771.1.3 (08-29-2025)
Moratoriums on Agency Grievance Matters
Types of moratoriums:
National Emergency - If the president declares a national emergency, such as the coronavirus disease pandemic, the IRS Human Capital Officer will decide if a moratorium on LR/ER activity (e.g., conduct or performance issues/actions) is appropriate and announce the beginning and ending dates.
Natural Disaster - If the president or other appropriate authority (e.g., city or state official) declares a geographic area as a natural disaster, the business-based human resources staff (also known as embedded) will collaborate with LERN and the Senior Commissioner’s Representative to determine if a moratorium is appropriate and announce the beginning and ending dates.
Note: Natural disasters are defined as any natural catastrophe (e.g., hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mud slide, snowstorm, or drought), or any fire, flood, or explosion, regardless of the cause, in any part of the United States, which the president or city/state official declares is causing damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance to help alleviate the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused by the disaster. Depending on the severity of the incident (e.g., explosion or fire), this may include a terrorist attack.
Winter Holiday Season - Annually during the winter holidays, beginning two Mondays before December 25 and ending in January, two Fridays after December 25 (e.g., December 16, 2024, through January 10, 2025).
What Occurs During a Moratorium - A moratorium does not prohibit all LR/ER activity (e.g., conduct or performance issues/actions). Management may continue with LR/ER activity if appropriate.
When a moratorium is in place, managers continue to work with a LERN specialist on LR/ER activity already in progress.
During a moratorium, for employees not serving a probationary/trial period or a temporary/term appointment, managers will consider and decide whether the following activities should be held in abeyance or if they should continue.
- Issuing grievance replies/decisions
- Holding grievance meetings
6.771.1.4 (08-29-2025)
Grievant’s Representative
Employees may choose a representative who is willing to serve and allowed by the GDO (see IRM 6.771.1.5, Disallowing Grievant’s Representative).
Employees may designate a representative at any grievance step.
Designation of the grievant’s representative must be in writing and given to the GDO.
Only one individual may serve as an employee’s representative.
Grievants may change the designation of a representative at any time.
6.771.1.5 (08-29-2025)
Disallowing Grievant’s Representative
The IRS will allow grievants to choose a representative unless such choice:
Creates a conflict of interest or position - This occurs when the representative’s IRS duties conflict with the functions of the representative. For example, when a GDO’s manager is chosen by the grievant to serve as his/her representative.
Imposes unreasonable costs to the government - This can include any travel costs or expenses requested by the representative to fulfill his/her role.
Conflicts with the priority needs of the IRS - The IRS mission takes precedence. The requested representative may be disallowed if a priority work assignment precludes his/her release from official duties. Use the same criteria as approving annual leave.
If applicable, within 15 calendar days of receiving the grievant’s written designation of representative, the GDO will provide a written disallowance decision to the grievant and the disallowed representative. The disallowance decision includes the grievant’s appeal rights and becomes part of the case file.
Within 15 calendar days of receiving the disallowance decision, the grievant (not the disallowed representative) may appeal the disallowance decision by:
Submitting a written appeal (via email) to LERN’s Field Operations Deputy Director named in the disallowance decision. To find the name of the Deputy Director of Field Operations, see Labor/Employee Relations & Negotiations Contacts.
Attaching a copy of the disallowance decision to his/her appeal.
Within 20 calendar days of receiving the appeal of the disallowance decision, the LERN Field Operations Deputy Director will make and communicate a final decision on either allowing or disallowing the representative. The disallowance decision is not grievable, and the grievance process resumes after the decision is issued.
6.771.1.6 (08-29-2025)
Employee Coverage
Agency grievances cover the following individuals:
Current NBU employees,
Current BU employees if the grievance issue is not covered under the NA (e.g., the ranking procedures used to fill a supervisory position) and
Former IRS employees on a matter that arose during their IRS employment with a plausible remedy (e.g., a pay issue) after separation.
Agency grievances are not available to the following individuals:
Applicants for employment,
BU employees if the matter grieved is covered by the NA,
Former IRS employees unless the matter grieved arose during their employment and could lead to a remedy after separation (e.g., a pay issue) and
Estate of deceased employees unless the grievance involves a pay-related matter.
Note: Proof of appointment must be provided by a court-appointed personal representative or the executor of the estate prior to releasing any information.
6.771.1.7 (08-29-2025)
Grievance Coverage
Except as listed below, agency grievances apply to matters relating to the employment of a covered employee that is subject to management’s control.
Employees cannot file an EEO complaint and an agency grievance on the same issue. If an employee files a formal agency grievance and files an EEO complaint for the same issue, whichever was filed first prevails.
Note: If an employee files an EEO complaint that is rejected or denied, the employee may file an agency grievance within 20 calendar days of receiving the EEO decision provided the matter is grievable (see paragraph 3 below).
Agency grievances exclude matters about:
The content of established IRS regulations and policies,
Any matter subject to review and adjudication by the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the FLRA, or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. See IRM 6.771.1.7.1, Appealable Decisions Excluded from Agency Grievances,

Grievance - Step 1
Before filing a formal grievance, employees are encouraged to seek informal resolution as soon as possible and no later than 14 calendar days from the event or the date the employee became aware of the matter being grieved.
Note: Seeking informal resolution does not extend the timeframe to file a formal grievance.
In the event a formal grievance is filed, the GDO, the grievant (and the representative (if applicable)) will try to resolve the grievance at the lowest level of the grievance process.
If an employee chooses to formally grieve a personal work-related issue (other than a disciplinary action), he/she must complete Form 5877 and provide it to the second-level manager within 20 calendar days of the event or the date the employee became aware of the matter being grieved. Employees should present a matter of personal concern about a continuing practice/condition as soon as possible.
Note: For grievances on disciplinary actions, see IRM 6.771.1.9, Grievance - Step 2.
Upon receipt of Form 5877, the second-level manager will contact LERN to discuss the grievance and next steps (See IRM 6.771.1.1.3, Responsibilities, paragraph 4, for LERN contact information). The second-level manager will review Form 5877 to decide if he/she has the authority to provide the remedy requested. If the second-level manager cannot provide the relief requested, he/she will provide Form 5877 and any supporting documents to the proper GDO within seven calendar days.
Note: The Step 1 manager may delegate the grievance to a GDO at a lower level. In addition, the Step 1 GDO may be outside the grievant's management chain if the remedy cannot be granted by the grievant’s management chain.
The Step 1 GDO procedures:
Within 10 calendar days of receiving Form 5877, review the grievance and any supporting documentation, and if necessary, issue a written threshold decision. See IRM 6.771.1.10, Threshold Information.
Within 15 calendar days of receiving Form 5877, hold a Step 1 meeting with the grievant (and his/her representative (if applicable)) if there are no threshold issues, to consider the issue(s) and the remedy requested.
Within 15 calendar days of holding the grievance meeting, issue a written decision. The written decision will include:
- A summary of the Step 1 issue(s),
- A summary of the consideration given to the issue(s),
- The conclusion(s) reached,
- The decision on the issue(s) including any remedy/remedies,
- The next higher-level manager (i.e., the Step 2 GDO) to submit an appeal and
- Appeal rights to Step 2 and the 20 calendar-day time limit.
Within 20 calendar days of receiving the Step 1 decision, if the grievant disagrees and chooses to appeal, he/she may submit a written appeal to the Step 2 GDO named in the grievance response stating the issue was not resolved at Step 1. The grievant will attach Form 5877 and any supporting documentation.
Note: No new issue(s) may be added to the Step 2 grievance (i.e., issues not stated on Form 5877 or raised in the Step 1 grievance meeting).
6.771.1.9 (08-29-2025)
Grievance - Step 2
Step 2 grievances involve consideration of disciplinary actions and appeals of Step 1 decisions.
Disciplinary Actions - If an employee chooses to grieve a disciplinary action, he/she must complete Form 5877 and provide it to the third-level manager within 20 calendar days. After receiving the grievance, the manager will confirm he/she is the Step 2 GDO. If he/she is not the GDO, Form 5877 is sent to the proper GDO with any supporting documentation within seven calendar days.
Note: The Step 2 manager may delegate the grievance to a GDO at a lower level.
Appeals of Step 1 Decisions - After receiving the appeal of the Step 1 decision, the GDO named in the Step 1 decision will confirm he/she is the Step 2 GDO. If he/she is not the GDO, Form 5877 is sent to the proper GDO with any supporting documentation within seven calendar days.
Note: The Step 2 GDO must not consider any issue(s) not previously raised in the Step 1 grievance.
The Step 2 GDO procedures:
The Step 2 GDO will contact the assigned LERN specialist to discuss the grievance and next steps. See IRM 6.771.1.1.3, Responsibilities, paragraph 6, for LERN contact information.
Within 10 calendar days of receiving Form 5877, review the grievance and any supporting documentation and if necessary, issue a written threshold decision. See IRM 6.771.1.10, Threshold Information.
Note: If a factual dispute is raised, the Step 2 GDO may request a factfinder. See IRM 6.771.1.11, Factfinding.
Within 15 calendar days of receiving Form 5877, hold a Step 2 meeting with the grievant (and his/her representative (if applicable)) if there are no threshold issues, to consider the issues and the remedy requested.
Within 15 calendar days of the Step 2 meeting (if a factfinder has not been requested), issue a written decision. The written decision will include:
- A summary of the Step 2 issue(s),
- A summary of the consideration given to the issue(s), including any fact-finding information (if applicable),
- The conclusion(s) reached,
- The decision on the issue(s) including any remedy/remedies and
- The following statement: This Step 2 decision is final, binding, and not subject to further review.
6.771.1.10 (08-29-2025)

6.771.1.10.1 (08-29-2025)
Threshold Denials
Within 10 calendar days of receiving Form 5877, the GDO in conjunction with the LERN specialist provides a written threshold decision to include the appeal process if the grievance does not meet all threshold issues.
Within 15 calendar days of receiving a threshold decision, employees may appeal to the LERN Field Operations Deputy Director named in the decision.
6.771.1.10.2 (08-29-2025)
Threshold Appeals

The appeal decision will include:
A summary of the issue(s) leading to the threshold denial,
A summary of the consideration given to the issue(s),
The reason(s) for the threshold denial,
The appeal decision and
The following statement: This threshold appeal decision is final, binding, and not subject to further review.
6.771.1.11 (08-29-2025)
Factfinding
The Step 2 GDO may request a factfinder to address a factual dispute prior to issuing a Step 2 decision.
To request a factfinder, the GDO contacts a LERN specialist for information (see IRM 6.771.1.1.3, Responsibilities, paragraph 4, for contact information).
A factfinder may obtain the evidence necessary to address the issue(s) within a reasonable time.
The factfinder provides his/her preliminary findings to the GDO, the grievant (and the representative (if applicable)).
The GDO, the grievant (and the representative (if applicable)) have eight calendar days to independently review the information. If the GDO, the grievant (and the representative (if applicable)) have more evidence and/or comments, they must provide a written reply/email to the factfinder.
After the factfinder reviews the additional information, if provided, from the GDO, the grievant (and the representative (if applicable)), he/she will prepare a written analysis of the findings and send it to the GDO, the grievant (and the representative (if applicable)) and the LERN specialist.
If the GDO decides more fact-finding is necessary (e.g., finding(s) are insufficient or inadequate), he/she may ask for additional fact-finding. If this occurs, the GDO will inform the grievant (and the representative (if applicable)) of the reason for his/her request. If the factfinder changes the analysis, he/she will send copies to the GDO, the grievant (and the representative (if applicable)) and the LERN specialist.
Within 15 calendar days of receiving the final written analysis of findings, the GDO will issue a written Step 2 decision. See IRM 6.771.1.9, Grievance - Step 2, paragraph 4d.
6.771.1.12 (08-29-2025)
Cancellation or Rejection of a Grievance
At any time prior to issuing the final decision (at any step), a GDO may cancel or reject a grievance:
At the grievant’s request,
Due to the grievant’s termination/separation from the IRS, unless a remedy for the former employee’s concern may be granted after termination,
For failure to pursue the grievance in an acceptable manner (e.g., the grievant does not provide information requested that is necessary to address the concern),
For failure to specify the personal relief (remedy) requested,
Because the matter(s) is not within management’s control to resolve,
By an employee who is not covered by this IRM (e.g., a BU employee submits Form 5877 when he/she should be following Article 41 of the addendum to the NA) and/or
If this IRM is not followed.
The written notice of cancellation or rejection will include:
The reason(s),
Citation(s) (e.g., an IRM section) and
Appeals rights with 15 calendar-day time limit.
Within 15 calendar days of receiving the notice of cancellation or rejection, if the grievant (or representative (if applicable)) chooses to appeal, he/she may submit an appeal via email to the LERN Field Operations Deputy Director named in the written notice of cancellation or rejection. To find the name of the Deputy Director of Field Operations, see Labor/Employee Relations & Negotiations Contacts.
Within 20 calendar days of receiving the appeal, the LERN Field Operations Deputy Director will issue a written decision to the grievant and provide copies to the grievant’s manager and the LERN specialist.
If the decision is upheld, the grievance is closed. The decision is final, binding and not subject to further review.
If the decision is in favor of the grievant, the grievance is returned to the GDO to address the grievance.
